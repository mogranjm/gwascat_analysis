TI  - Genome-wide association study of germline variants and breast cancer-specific
      mortality.
PG  - 647-657

AB  - BACKGROUND: We examined the associations between germline variants and breast
      cancer mortality using a large meta-analysis of women of European ancestry.
      METHODS: Meta-analyses included summary estimates based on Cox models of twelve
      datasets using ~10.4 million variants for 96,661 women with breast cancer and
      7697 events (breast cancer-specific deaths). Oestrogen receptor (ER)-specific
      analyses were based on 64,171 ER-positive (4116) and 16,172 ER-negative (2125)
      patients. We evaluated the probability of a signal to be a true positive using
      the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP). RESULTS: We did not find any
      variant associated with breast cancer-specific mortality at P < 5 x 10(-8). For
      ER-positive disease, the most significantly associated variant was chr7:rs4717568
      (BFDP = 7%, P = 1.28 x 10(-7), hazard ratio [HR] = 0.88, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI] = 0.84-0.92); the closest gene is AUTS2. For ER-negative disease, the most
      significant variant was chr7:rs67918676 (BFDP = 11%, P = 1.38 x 10(-7), HR =
      1.27, 95% CI = 1.16-1.39); located within a long intergenic non-coding RNA gene
      (AC004009.3), close to the HOXA gene cluster. CONCLUSIONS: We uncovered germline 
      variants on chromosome 7 at BFDP < 15% close to genes for which there is
      biological evidence related to breast cancer outcome. However, the paucity of
      variants associated with mortality at genome-wide significance underpins the
      challenge in providing genetic-based individualised prognostic information for
      breast cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Differentiating between cancer patients who will experience
      metastasis within a short time and who will be long-term survivors without
      metastasis is a critical aim in healthcare. The microsatellite instability
      (MSI)-high tumor phenotype is such a differentiator in colorectal cancer, as
      patients with these tumors are unlikely to experience metastasis. Our aim in this
      study was to determine if germline genetic variations could further differentiate
      colorectal cancer patients based on the long-term risk and timing of metastasis. 
      METHODS: The patient cohort consisted of 379 stage I-III Caucasian colorectal
      cancer patients with microsatellite stable or MSI-low tumors. We performed
      univariable analysis on 810,622 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      under different genetic models. Depending on the long-term metastasis-free
      survival probability estimates, we applied a mixture cure model, Cox proportional
      hazards regression model, or log-rank test. For SNPs reaching
      Bonferroni-corrected significance (p < 6.2 x 10(- 8)) having valid genetic
      models, multivariable analysis adjusting for significant baseline characteristics
      was conducted. RESULTS: After adjusting for significant baseline characteristics,
      specific genotypes of ten polymorphisms were significantly associated with
      time-to-metastasis. These polymorphisms are three intergenic SNPs, rs5749032 (p =
      1.28 x 10(- 10)), rs2327990 (p = 9.59 x 10(- 10)), rs1145724 (p = 3 x 10(- 8)),
      and seven SNPs within the non-coding sequences of three genes: FHIT (p = 2.59 x
      10(- 9)), EPHB1 (p = 8.23 x 10(- 9)), and MIR7515 (p = 4.87 x 10(- 8)).
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest novel associations of specific genotypes of SNPs
      with early metastasis in Caucasian colorectal cancer patients. These
      associations, once replicated in other patient cohorts, could assist in the
      development of personalized treatment strategies for colorectal cancer patients.

AB  - EGFR-antibodies are associated with significant skin toxicity, including
      acneiform rash and folliculitis. It remains impossible to predict the occurrence 
      of severe skin toxicity due to the lack of predictive markers. Here, we present
      the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with EGFR inhibitor-induced skin toxicity using
      data of the multicentre randomized phase III CAIRO2 trial (clinicaltrials.gov
      NCT00208546). In this study, advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer patients
      were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab with or without
      cetuximab. Germline DNA was available in 282 of the 368 patients in the cetuximab
      arm. Mild skin toxicity occurred in 195 patients (i.e. CTC grade 1 or 2,
      respectively 91 and 104 patients) and severe skin toxicity (i.e. grade 3) in 36
      patients. Grade 4 skin toxicity did not occur. None of the SNPs reached the
      formal genome wide threshold for significance of 5x10(-8), though SNPs of at
      least 8 loci did show moderate association (p-value between 5x10(-7) and
      5x10(-5)) with the occurrence of grade 3 (severe) skin toxicity. These SNPs did
      not overlap with SNPs associated with cetuximab efficacy as found in a previous
      GWAS in the same CAIRO2 cohort. If formally proven by replication, the SNPs
      associated with severe EGFR induced skin toxicity may be helpful to predict the
      occurrence and severity of skin toxicity in patients that will receive cetuximab 
      and allow for adequate information on the risk of skin toxicity and prophylactic 
      measurements.

TI  - Genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ovarian cancer in Japanese predicted
      regulatory variants in 22q13.1.
PG  - e0209096
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0209096 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified greater than 30 variants
      associated with ovarian cancer, but most of these variants were investigated in
      European populations. Here, we integrated GWAS and subsequent functional analyses
      to identify the genetic variants with potential regulatory effects. We conducted 
      GWAS for ovarian cancer using 681 Japanese cases and 17,492 controls and found
      that rs137672 on 22q13.1 exhibited a strong association with a P-value of 1.05 x 
      10(-7) and an odds ratio of 0.573 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.466-0.703. 
      In addition, three previously reported SNPs, i.e., rs10088218, rs9870207 and
      rs1400482, were validated in the Japanese population (P < 0.05) with the same
      risk allele as noted in previous studies. Functional studies including regulatory
      feature analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed two
      regulatory SNPs in 22q13.1, rs2072872 and rs6509, that affect the binding
      affinity to some nuclear proteins in ovarian cancer cells. The plausible
      regulatory proteins whose motifs could be affected by the allele changes of these
      two SNPs were also proposed. Moreover, the protective G allele of rs6509 was
      associated with a decreased SYNGR1 expression level in normal ovarian tissues.
      Our findings elucidated the regulatory variants in 22q13.1 that are associated
      with ovarian cancer risk.

AB  - The development of cervical cancer is initiated by human papillomavirus (HPV)
      infection and involves both viral and host genetic factors. Genome-wide
      association studies (GWAS) of cervical cancer have identified associations in the
      HLA locus and two loci outside HLA, but the principal genes that control
      infection and pathogenesis have not been identified. In the present study, we
      performed GWAS of cervical cancer in East Asian populations, involving 2609 cases
      and 4712 controls in the discovery stage and 1461 cases and 3295 controls in the 
      follow-up stage. We identified novel-significant associations at 5q14 with the
      lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs59661306 (P = 2.4 x 10-11) and at
      7p11 with the lead SNP rs7457728 (P = 1.2 x 10-8). In 5q14, the chromatin region 
      of the GWAS-significant SNPs was found to be in contact with the promoter of the 
      ARRDC3 (arrestin domain-containing 3) gene. In our functional studies, ARRDC3
      knockdown in HeLa cells caused significant reductions in both cell growth and
      susceptibility to HPV16 pseudovirion infection, suggesting that ARRDC3 is
      involved in the infectious entry of HPV into the cell. Our study advances the
      understanding of host genes that are responsible for cervical cancer
      susceptibility and guides future research on HPV infection and cancer
      development.

      susceptibility loci and their potential impacts.
PG  - 15263
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-31859-8 [doi]
AB  - "BRCAX" refers breast cancers occurring in women with a family history predictive
      of being a BRCA1/2 mutation carrier, but BRCA1/2 genetic screening has failed to 
      find causal mutations. In this study, we report the findings of the genetic
      architecture of BRCAX with novel and redefined candidate loci and their potential
      impacts on preventive strategy. We performed a genome-wide association study
      involving 1,469 BRCAX cases from the Korean Hereditary Breast Cancer study, and
      high-risk breast cancer cases (1,482 Asians and 9,902 Europeans) from the Breast 
      Cancer Association Consortium. We also evaluated the previously reported
      susceptibility loci for their roles in the high-risk breast cancers. We have
      identified three novel loci (PDE7B, UBL3, and a new independent marker in
      CDKN2B-AS1) associated with BRCAX, and replicated previously reported SNPs (24 of
      92) and moderate/high-penetrance (seven of 23) genes for Korean BRCAX. For the
      novel candidate loci, evidence supported their roles in regulatory function. We
      estimated that the common low-penetrance loci might explain a substantial part of
      high-risk breast cancer (39.4% for Koreans and 24.0% for Europeans). Our study
      findings suggest that common genetic markers with lower penetrance constitute a
      part of susceptibility to high-risk breast cancers, with potential implications
      for a more comprehensive genetic screening test.

AB  - Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality in Japan and
      worldwide. Although previous studies identify various genetic variations
      associated with gastric cancer, host genetic factors are largely unidentified. To
      identify novel gastric cancer loci in the Japanese population, herein, we carried
      out a large-scale genome-wide association study using 6171 cases and 27 178
      controls followed by three replication analyses. Analysis using a total of 11 507
      cases and 38 904 controls identified two novel loci on 12q24.11-12 (rs6490061, P 
      = 3.20 x 10(-8) with an odds ratio [OR] of 0.905) and 20q11.21 (rs2376549, P =
      8.11 x 10(-10) with an OR of 1.109). rs6490061 is located at intron 19 of the
      CUX2 gene, and its expression was suppressed by Helicobacter pylori infection.
      rs2376549 is included within the gene cluster of DEFB families that encode
      antibacterial peptides. We also found a significant association of rs7849280 in
      the ABO gene locus on 9q34.2 (P = 2.64 x 10(-13) with an OR of 1.148). CUX2 and
      ABO expression in gastric mucosal tissues was significantly associated with
      rs6490061 and rs7849280 (P = 0.0153 and 8.00 x 10(-11) ), respectively. Our
      findings show the crucial roles of genetic variations in the pathogenesis of
      gastric cancer.

      exploratory study.

AB  - AIM: Cancer pain impairs not only physical functions but also social functions
      and roles. Consequently, the overall health-related quality of life of patients
      with cancer pain deteriorates. Opioid analgesics are recommended for treating
      moderate to strong cancer pain. Advances in human genome research have fueled a
      growing interest to understand individual differences in responsiveness to opioid
      analgesics. This study aimed to explore and identify novel loci for genes
      predisposing an individual to opioid analgesic responsiveness. METHODS: A total
      of 71 cancer patients rated their pain on an 11-point numerical rating scale
      twice before and after increasing opioid analgesics. A genomewide association
      study focusing on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted to
      associate pain decrease with increased dosage of opioid analgesics based on
      weight (ie, responsiveness to opioid analgesics). A genomewide significance (P < 
      5E-8) was set for multiplicity of analyses to control for false positives.
      RESULTS: Two SNPs passed the genomewide threshold for significance. One exonic
      SNP (rs1641025) was located in the ABAT [4-aminobutyrate aminotransaminase (GABA 
      transaminase)] gene on chromosome 16. The other SNP (rs12494691) was located on
      chromosome 3, which was not associated with any known genes. These SNPs were not 
      associated with opioid-related adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      preliminarily suggest that both SNPs might be potential candidate loci for
      responsiveness to opioid analgesics, and GABA transaminase might be a possible
      target for developing adjuvant pharmacotherapy with opioid analgesics in adjuvant
      pharmacotherapy. Our results should be validated in a large-scale study with a
      larger sample size.

AB  - PURPOSE: Although association studies of genetic variations with the clinical
      outcomes of breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen have been reported,
      genetic factors which could determine individual response to tamoxifen are not
      fully clarified. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify 
      novel genetic markers for response to tamoxifen. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We
      prospectively collected 347 blood samples from patients with hormone
      receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, invasive
      breast cancer receiving preoperative tamoxifen monotherapy for 14 to 28 days. We 
      used Ki-67 response in breast cancer tissues after preoperative short-term
      tamoxifen therapy as a surrogate marker for response to tamoxifen. We performed
      GWAS and genotype imputation using 275 patients, and an independent set of 72
      patients was used for replication study. RESULTS: The combined result of GWAS and
      the replication study, and subsequent imputation analysis indicated possible
      association of three loci with Ki-67 response after tamoxifen therapy (rs17198973
      on chromosome 4q34.3, rs4577773 on 6q12, and rs7087428 on 10p13, Pcombined = 5.69
      x 10-6, 1.64 x 10-5, and 9.77 x 10-6, respectively). When patients were
      classified into three groups by the scoring system based on the genotypes of the 
      three SNPs, patients with higher scores showed significantly higher after/before 
      ratio of Ki-67 compared to those with lower scores (P = 1.8 x 10-12), suggesting 
      the cumulative effect of the three SNPs. CONCLUSION: We identified three novel
      loci, which could be associated with clinical response to tamoxifen. These
      findings provide new insights into personalized hormonal therapy for the patients
      with breast cancer.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified the chromosome 15q25.1 locus as
      a leading susceptibility region for lung cancer. However, the pathogenic
      pathways, through which susceptibility SNPs within chromosome 15q25.1 affects
      lung cancer risk, have not been explored. We analyzed three cohorts with GWAS
      data consisting 42,901 individuals and lung expression quantitative trait loci
      (eQTL) data on 409 individuals to identify and validate the underlying pathways
      and to investigate the combined effect of genes from the identified
      susceptibility pathways. The KEGG neuroactive ligand receptor interaction
      pathway, two Reactome pathways, and 22 Gene Ontology terms were identified and
      replicated to be significantly associated with lung cancer risk, with P values
      less than 0.05 and FDR less than 0.1. Functional annotation of eQTL analysis
      results showed that the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway and gated
      channel activity were involved in lung cancer risk. These pathways provide
      important insights for the etiology of lung cancer.

TI  - Identification of nine new susceptibility loci for endometrial cancer.
PG  - 3166
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-05427-7 [doi]
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer of the female
      reproductive tract in developed countries. Through genome-wide association
      studies (GWAS), we have previously identified eight risk loci for endometrial
      cancer. Here, we present an expanded meta-analysis of 12,906 endometrial cancer
      cases and 108,979 controls (including new genotype data for 5624 cases) and
      identify nine novel genome-wide significant loci, including a locus on 12q24.12
      previously identified by meta-GWAS of endometrial and colorectal cancer. At five 
      loci, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses identify candidate
      causal genes; risk alleles at two of these loci associate with decreased
      expression of genes, which encode negative regulators of oncogenic signal
      transduction proteins (SH2B3 (12q24.12) and NF1 (17q11.2)). In summary, this
      study has doubled the number of known endometrial cancer risk loci and revealed
      candidate causal genes for future study.

TI  - Genetic modifiers of radon-induced lung cancer risk: a genome-wide interaction
      study in former uranium miners.
PG  - 937-950
LID - 10.1007/s00420-018-1334-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Radon is a risk factor for lung cancer and uranium miners are more
      exposed than the general population. A genome-wide interaction analysis was
      carried out to identify genomic loci, genes or gene sets that modify the
      susceptibility to lung cancer given occupational exposure to the radioactive gas 
      radon. METHODS: Samples from 28 studies provided by the International Lung Cancer
      Consortium were pooled with samples of former uranium miners collected by the
      German Federal Office of Radiation Protection. In total, 15,077 cases and 13,522 
      controls, all of European ancestries, comprising 463 uranium miners were
      compared. The DNA of all participants was genotyped with the OncoArray. We fitted
      single-marker and in multi-marker models and performed an exploratory gene-set
      analysis to detect cumulative enrichment of significance in sets of genes.
      RESULTS: We discovered a genome-wide significant interaction of the marker
      rs12440014 within the gene CHRNB4 (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.11-0.60, p = 0.0386
      corrected for multiple testing). At least suggestive significant interaction of
      linkage disequilibrium blocks was observed at the chromosomal regions 18q21.23 (p
      = 1.2 x 10(-6)), 5q23.2 (p = 2.5 x 10(-6)), 1q21.3 (p = 3.2 x 10(-6)), 10p13 (p =
      1.3 x 10(-5)) and 12p12.1 (p = 7.1 x 10(-5)). Genes belonging to the Gene
      Ontology term "DNA dealkylation involved in DNA repair" (GO:0006307; p = 0.0139) 
      or the gene family HGNC:476 "microRNAs" (p = 0.0159) were enriched with
      LD-blockwise significance. CONCLUSION: The well-established association of the
      genomic region 15q25 to lung cancer might be influenced by exposure to radon
      among uranium miners. Furthermore, lung cancer susceptibility is related to the
      functional capability of DNA damage signaling via ubiquitination processes and
      repair of radiation-induced double-strand breaks by the single-strand annealing
      mechanism.

TI  - Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms with mucinous colorectal cancer: 
      genome-wide common variant and gene-based rare variant analyses.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s40364-018-0133-z [doi]
AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer has significant impact on individuals and
      healthcare systems. Many genes have been identified to influence its
      pathogenesis. However, the genetic basis of mucinous tumor histology, an
      aggressive subtype of colorectal cancer, is currently not well-known. This study 
      aimed to identify common and rare genetic variations that are associated with the
      mucinous tumor phenotype. Methods: Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism
      (SNP) data was investigated in a colorectal cancer patient cohort (n = 505).
      Association analyses were performed for 729,373 common SNPs and 275,645 rare
      SNPs. Common SNP association analysis was performed using univariable and
      multivariable logistic regression under different genetic models. Rare-variant
      association analysis was performed using a multi-marker test. Results: No
      associations reached the traditional genome-wide significance. However, promising
      genetic associations were identified. The identified common SNPs significantly
      improved the discriminatory accuracy of the model for mucinous tumor phenotype.
      Specifically, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
      increased from 0.703 (95% CI: 0.634-0.773) to 0.916 (95% CI: 0.873-0.960) when
      considering the most significant SNPs. Additionally, the rare variant analysis
      identified a number of genetic regions that potentially contain causal rare
      variants associated with the mucinous tumor phenotype. Conclusions: This is the
      first study applying both common and rare variant analyses to identify genetic
      associations with mucinous tumor phenotype using a genome-wide genotype data. Our
      results suggested novel associations with mucinous tumors. Once confirmed, these 
      results will not only help us understand the biological basis of mucinous
      histology, but may also help develop targeted treatment options for mucinous
      tumors.

PG  - 1135-1140
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgy080 [doi]
AB  - To identify genetic variation associated with lung cancer risk, we performed a
      genome-wide association analysis of 685 lung cancer cases that had a family
      history of two or more first or second degree relatives compared with 744
      controls without lung cancer that were genotyped on an Illumina Human
      OmniExpressExome-8v1 array. To ensure robust results, we further evaluated these 
      findings using data from six additional studies that were assembled through the
      Transdisciplinary Research on Cancer of the Lung Consortium comprising 1993
      familial cases and 33 690 controls. We performed a meta-analysis after imputation
      of all variants using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 (version 3 release date
      September 2013). Analyses were conducted for 9 327 222 SNPs integrating data from
      the two sources. A novel variant on chromosome 4p15.31 near the LCORL gene and an
      imputed rare variant intergenic between CDKN2A and IFNA8 on chromosome 9p21.3
      were identified at a genome-wide level of significance for squamous cell
      carcinomas. Additionally, associations of CHRNA3 and CHRNA5 on chromosome 15q25.1
      in sporadic lung cancer were confirmed at a genome-wide level of significance in 
      familial lung cancer. Previously identified variants in or near CHRNA2, BRCA2,
      CYP2A6 for overall lung cancer, TERT, SECISPB2L and RTEL1 for adenocarcinoma and 
      RAD52 and MHC for squamous carcinoma were significantly associated with lung
      cancer.

TI  - Novel Common Genetic Susceptibility Loci for Colorectal Cancer.
PG  - 146-157
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djy099 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 42
      loci (P < 5 x 10-8) associated with risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Expanded
      consortium efforts facilitating the discovery of additional susceptibility loci
      may capture unexplained familial risk. METHODS: We conducted a GWAS in European
      descent CRC cases and control subjects using a discovery-replication design,
      followed by examination of novel findings in a multiethnic sample (cumulative n =
      163 315). In the discovery stage (36 948 case subjects/30 864 control subjects), 
      we identified genetic variants with a minor allele frequency of 1% or greater
      associated with risk of CRC using logistic regression followed by a fixed-effects
      inverse variance weighted meta-analysis. All novel independent variants reaching 
      genome-wide statistical significance (two-sided P < 5 x 10-8) were tested for
      replication in separate European ancestry samples (12 952 case subjects/48 383
      control subjects). Next, we examined the generalizability of discovered variants 
      in East Asians, African Americans, and Hispanics (12 085 case subjects/22 083
      control subjects). Finally, we examined the contributions of novel risk variants 
      to familial relative risk and examined the prediction capabilities of a polygenic
      risk score. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The discovery GWAS
      identified 11 variants associated with CRC at P < 5 x 10-8, of which nine (at
      4q22.2/5p15.33/5p13.1/6p21.31/6p12.1/10q11.23/12q24.21/16q24.1/20q13.13)
      independently replicated at a P value of less than .05. Multiethnic follow-up
      supported the generalizability of discovery findings. These results demonstrated 
      a 14.7% increase in familial relative risk explained by common risk alleles from 
      10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 7.9% to 13.7%; known variants) to 11.9%
      (95% CI = 9.2% to 15.5%; known and novel variants). A polygenic risk score
      identified 4.3% of the population at an odds ratio for developing CRC of at least
      2.0. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the architecture of common
      genetic variation contributing to CRC etiology and improves risk prediction for
      individualized screening.

TI  - Association analyses of more than 140,000 men identify 63 new prostate cancer
      susceptibility loci.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and fine-mapping efforts to date have
      identified more than 100 prostate cancer (PrCa)-susceptibility loci. We
      meta-analyzed genotype data from a custom high-density array of 46,939 PrCa cases
      and 27,910 controls of European ancestry with previously genotyped data of 32,255
      PrCa cases and 33,202 controls of European ancestry. Our analysis identified 62
      novel loci associated (P < 5.0 x 10(-8)) with PrCa and one locus significantly
      associated with early-onset PrCa (</=55 years). Our findings include missense
      variants rs1800057 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16; P = 8.2 x 10(-9); G>C, p.Pro1054Arg) 
      in ATM and rs2066827 (OR = 1.06; P = 2.3 x 10(-9); T>G, p.Val109Gly) in CDKN1B.
      The combination of all loci captured 28.4% of the PrCa familial relative risk,
      and a polygenic risk score conferred an elevated PrCa risk for men in the
      ninetieth to ninety-ninth percentiles (relative risk = 2.69; 95% confidence
      interval (CI): 2.55-2.82) and first percentile (relative risk = 5.71; 95% CI:
      5.04-6.48) risk stratum compared with the population average. These findings
      improve risk prediction, enhance fine-mapping, and provide insight into the
      underlying biology of PrCa(1).

AB  - Neuropathic pain (NP), defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or
      dysfunction in the nervous system, is a debilitating chronic pain condition often
      resulting from cancer treatment. Among cancer patients, neuropathy during cancer 
      treatment is a predisposing event for NP. To identify genetic variants
      influencing the development of NP, we conducted a genome-wide association study
      in 1,043 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, based on
      714,494 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (130 cases, 913 controls).
      About 12.5% of the patients, who previously had cancer treatment, had
      neuropathy-associated diagnoses, as defined using the ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. We
      identified four common SNPs representing four genomic regions: 7q22.3
      (rs10950641; SNX8; P = 3.39 x 10(-14)), 19p13.2 (rs4804217; PCP2; P = 2.95 x
      10(-9)), 3q27.3 (rs6796803; KNG1; P = 6.42 x 10(-9)) and 15q22.2 (rs4775319;
      RORA; P = 1.02 x 10(-8)), suggesting SNX8, PCP2, KNG1 and RORA might be novel
      target genes for NP in patients with head and neck cancer. Future experimental
      validation to explore physiological effects of the identified SNPs will provide a
      better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying NP and may provide
      insights into novel therapeutic targets for treatment and management of NP.

AB  - The skin's tendency to sunburn rather than tan is a major risk factor for skin
      cancer. Here we report a large genome-wide association study of ease of skin
      tanning in 176,678 subjects of European ancestry. We identify significant
      association with tanning ability at 20 loci. We confirm previously identified
      associations at six of these loci, and report 14 novel loci, of which ten have
      never been associated with pigmentation-related phenotypes. Our results also
      suggest that variants at the AHR/AGR3 locus, previously associated with cutaneous
      malignant melanoma the underlying mechanism of which is poorly understood, might 
      act on disease risk through modulation of tanning ability.

TI  - Genetic susceptibility markers for a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype:
      Exploratory results from genome-wide association studies.
PG  - e0196245
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0196245 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clustering of breast and colorectal cancer has been observed within
      some families and cannot be explained by chance or known high-risk mutations in
      major susceptibility genes. Potential shared genetic susceptibility between
      breast and colorectal cancer, not explained by high-penetrance genes, has been
      postulated. We hypothesized that yet undiscovered genetic variants predispose to 
      a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. METHODS: To identify variants associated
      with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, we analyzed genome-wide association
      study (GWAS) data from cases and controls that met the following criteria: cases 
      (n = 985) were women with breast cancer who had one or more first- or
      second-degree relatives with colorectal cancer, men/women with colorectal cancer 
      who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer, and
      women diagnosed with both breast and colorectal cancer. Controls (n = 1769), were
      unrelated, breast and colorectal cancer-free, and age- and sex- frequency-matched
      to cases. After imputation, 6,220,060 variants were analyzed using the discovery 
      set and variants associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype at
      P<5.0E-04 (n = 549, at 60 loci) were analyzed for replication (n = 293 cases and 
      2,103 controls). RESULTS: Multiple correlated SNPs in intron 1 of the ROBO1 gene 
      were suggestively associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype in the
      discovery and replication data (most significant; rs7430339, Pdiscovery =
      1.2E-04; rs7429100, Preplication = 2.8E-03). In meta-analysis of the discovery
      and replication data, the most significant association remained at rs7429100 (P =
      1.84E-06). CONCLUSION: The results of this exploratory analysis did not find
      clear evidence for a susceptibility locus with a pleiotropic effect on hereditary
      breast and colorectal cancer risk, although the suggestive association of genetic
      variation in the region of ROBO1, a potential tumor suppressor gene, merits
      further investigation.

AB  - Epidemiological, biological, and molecular data suggest links between
      endometriosis and endometrial cancer, with recent epidemiological studies
      providing evidence for an association between a previous diagnosis of
      endometriosis and risk of endometrial cancer. We used genetic data as an
      alternative approach to investigate shared biological etiology of these two
      diseases. Genetic correlation analysis of summary level statistics from
      genomewide association studies (GWAS) using LD Score regression revealed moderate
      but significant genetic correlation (rg = 0.23, P = 9.3 x 10(-3) ), and SNP
      effect concordance analysis provided evidence for significant SNP pleiotropy (P =
      6.0 x 10(-3) ) and concordance in effect direction (P = 2.0 x 10(-3) ) between
      the two diseases. Cross-disease GWAS meta-analysis highlighted 13 distinct loci
      associated at P </= 10(-5) with both endometriosis and endometrial cancer, with
      one locus (SNP rs2475335) located within PTPRD associated at a genomewide
      significant level (P = 4.9 x 10(-8) , OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.07-1.15). PTPRD acts 
      in the STAT3 pathway, which has been implicated in both endometriosis and
      endometrial cancer. This study demonstrates the value of cross-disease genetic
      analysis to support epidemiological observations and to identify biological
      pathways of relevance to multiple diseases.

PG  - 652-660

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality
      worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified more than 50 CRC
      loci. However, most of the previous studies were conducted in European
      population, and host genetic factors among Japanese population are largely
      remained to be identified. To identify novel loci in the Japanese population,
      here, we performed a large-scale GWAS using 6692 cases and 27 178 controls
      followed by a replication analysis using more than 11 000 case-control samples.
      We found the significant association of 10 loci (P < 5 x 10-8), including 2 novel
      loci on 16q24.1 (IRF8-FOXF1, rs847208, P = 3.15 x 10-9 and odds ratio = 1.107
      with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.071-1.145) and 20q13.12 (TOX2, rs6065668, 
      P = 4.47 x 10-11 and odds ratio = 0.897 with 95% CI of 0.868-0.926). Moreover, 35
      previously reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 24 regions were
      validated in the Japanese population (P < 0.05) with the same risk allele as in
      the previous studies. SNP rs6065668 was significantly associated with TOX2
      expression in the sigmoid colon. In addition, nucleotide substitutions in the
      regulatory region of TOX2 were predicted to alter the binding of several
      transcription factors, including KLF5. Our findings elucidate the important role 
      of genetic variations in the development of CRC in the Japanese population.

      survivors of childhood cancer participating in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study
      (SJLIFE). Analyses were adjusted for cyclophosphamide equivalent dose of
      alkylating agents and ovarian radiotherapy (RT) dose (all P values two-sided).
      Replication was performed using self-reported PM in 1624 survivors participating 
      in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). Results: PM was clinically
      diagnosed in 30 (3.8%) SJLIFE participants. Thirteen SNPs (70 kb region of
      chromosome 4q32.1) upstream of the Neuropeptide Receptor 2 gene (NPY2R) were
      associated with PM prevalence (minimum P = 3.3 x 10-7 for rs9999820, all P <
      10-5). Being a homozygous carrier of a haplotype formed by four of the 13 SNPs
      (seen in one in seven in the general population but more than 50% of SJLIFE
      clinically diagnosed PM) was associated with markedly elevated PM prevalence
      among survivors exposed to ovarian RT (odds ratio [OR] = 25.89, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 6.18 to 138.31, P = 8.2 x 10-6); this finding was replicated in
      an independent second cohort of CCSS in spite of its use of self-reported PM (OR 
      = 3.97, 95% CI = 1.67 to 9.41, P = .002). Evidence from bioinformatics data
      suggests that the haplotype alters the regulation of NPY2R transcription,
      possibly affecting PM risk through neuroendocrine pathways. Conclusions: The
      haplotype captures the majority of clinically diagnosed PM cases and, with
      further validation, may have clinical application in identifying the highest-risk
      survivors for PM for possible intervention by cryopreservation.

PG  - 4249-4257
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.22747 [doi]
AB  - The majority of breast cancers are driven by the female hormone oestrogen via
      oestrogen receptor (ER) alpha. ER-positive patients are commonly treated with
      adjuvant endocrine therapy, however, resistance is a common occurrence and aside 
      from ER-status, no unequivocal predictive biomarkers are currently in clinical
      use. In this study, we aimed to identify constitutional genetic variants
      influencing breast cancer survival among ER-positive patients and specifically,
      among endocrine-treated patients. We conducted a meta-analysis of three
      genome-wide association studies comprising in total 3,136 patients with
      ER-positive breast cancer of which 2,751 had received adjuvant endocrine therapy.
      We identified a novel locus (rs992531 at 8p21.2) associated with reduced survival
      among the patients with ER-positive breast cancer (P = 3.77 x 10(-8)). Another
      locus (rs7701292 at 5q21.3) was associated with reduced survival among the
      endocrine-treated patients (P = 2.13 x 10(-8)). Interaction analysis indicated
      that the survival association of rs7701292 is treatment-specific and independent 
      of conventional prognostic markers. In silico functional studies suggest
      plausible biological mechanisms for the observed survival associations and a
      functional link between the putative target genes of the rs992531 and rs7701292
      (RHOBTB2 and RAB9P1, respectively). We further explored the genetic interaction
      between rs992531 and rs7701292 and found a significant, treatment-specific
      interactive effect on survival among ER-positive, endocrine-treated patients
      (hazard ratio = 6.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.79-27.08, Pinteraction= 0.036). 
      This is the first study to identify a genetic interaction that specifically
      predicts treatment outcome. These findings may provide predictive biomarkers
      based on germ line genotype informing more personalized treatment selection.

TI  - Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies five new susceptibility loci for pancreatic 
      cancer.
PG  - 556
LID - 10.1038/s41467-018-02942-5 [doi]
AB  - In 2020, 146,063 deaths due to pancreatic cancer are estimated to occur in Europe
      and the United States combined. To identify common susceptibility alleles, we
      performed the largest pancreatic cancer GWAS to date, including 9040 patients and
      12,496 controls of European ancestry from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium
      (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Here, we
      find significant evidence of a novel association at rs78417682 (7p12/TNS3, P =
      4.35 x 10(-8)). Replication of 10 promising signals in up to 2737 patients and
      4752 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium yields
      new genome-wide significant loci: rs13303010 at 1p36.33 (NOC2L, P = 8.36 x
      10(-14)), rs2941471 at 8q21.11 (HNF4G, P = 6.60 x 10(-10)), rs4795218 at 17q12
      (HNF1B, P = 1.32 x 10(-8)), and rs1517037 at 18q21.32 (GRP, P = 3.28 x 10(-8)).
      rs78417682 is not statistically significantly associated with pancreatic cancer
      in PANDoRA. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in three independent
      pancreatic data sets provides molecular support of NOC2L as a pancreatic cancer
      susceptibility gene.

AB  - Identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence chemotherapy
      disposition may help to personalize cancer treatment and limit toxicity.
      Genome-wide approaches are unbiased, compared with candidate gene studies, but
      usually require large cohorts. As most chemotherapy is given cyclically multiple 
      blood sampling is required to adequately define drug disposition, limiting
      patient recruitment. We found that carboplatin and paclitaxel disposition are
      stable phenotypes in ovarian cancer patients and tested a genome-wide association
      study (GWAS) design to identify SNPs associated with chemotherapy disposition. We
      found highly significant SNPs in ABCC2, a known carboplatin transporter,
      associated with carboplatin clearance (asymptotic P = 5.2 x 10(6), empirical P = 
      1.4 x 10(-5)), indicating biological plausibility. We also identified novel SNPs 
      associated with paclitaxel disposition, including rs17130142 with genome-wide
      significance (asymptotic P = 2.0 x 10(-9), empirical P = 1.3 x 10(-7)). Although 
      requiring further validation, our work demonstrated that GWAS of chemotherapeutic
      drug disposition can be effective, even in relatively small cohorts, and can be
      adopted in drug development and treatment programs.

TI  - Genetic risk of prostate cancer in Ugandan men.
PG  - 370-376
LID - 10.1002/pros.23481 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Men of African-ancestry have elevated prostate cancer (PCa) incidence
      and mortality compared to men of other racial groups. There is support for a
      genetic contribution to this disparity, with evidence of genetic heterogeneity in
      the underlying risk alleles between populations. Studies of PCa among African men
      may inform the contribution of genetic risk factors to the elevated disease
      burden in this population. METHODS: We conducted an association study of >100
      previously reported PCa risk alleles among 571 incidence cases and 485 controls
      among Uganda men. Unconditional logistic regression was used to test genetic
      associations and a polygenic risk score (PRS) was derived to assess the
      cumulative effect of the known risk alleles in association with PCa risk. In an
      exploratory analysis, we also tested associations of 17 125 421 genotyped and
      imputed markers genome-wide in association with PCa risk. RESULTS: Of the 111
      known risk loci with a frequency >1%, 75 (68%) had effects that were
      directionally consistent with the initial discovery population,14 (13%) of which 
      were nominally significantly associated with PCa risk at P < 0.05. Compared to
      men with average risk (25(th) -75(th) percentile in PRS distribution), Ugandan
      men in the top 10% of the PRS, constructed of alleles outside of 8q24, had a
      2.9-fold (95%CI: 1.75, 4.97) risk of developing PCa; risk for the top 10%
      increased to 4.86 (95%CI: 2.70, 8.76) with the inclusion of risk alleles at 8q24.
      In genome-wide association testing, the strongest associations were noted with
      known risk alleles located in the 8q24 region, including rs72725854 (OR = 3.37, P
      = 2.14 x 10(-11) ) that is limited to populations of African ancestry (6%
      frequency). CONCLUSIONS: The approximately 100 known PCa risk variants were shown
      to effectively stratify PCa risk in Ugandan men, with 10% of men having a >4-fold
      increase in risk. The 8q24 risk region was also found to be a major contributor
      to PCa risk in Ugandan men, with the African ancestry-specific risk variant
      rs72725854 estimated to account for 12% of PCa in this population.

AB  - A germline mutation in cancer predisposing genes is known to increase the risk of
      more than one tumor type. In order to find loci associated with many types of
      cancer, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted, and 3,555 Swedish
      cancer cases and 15,581 controls were analyzed for 226,883 SNPs. The study used
      haplotype analysis instead of single SNP analysis in order to find putative
      founder effects. Haplotype association studies identified seven risk loci
      associated with cancer risk, on chromosomes 1, 7, 11, 14, 16, 17 and 21. Four of 
      the haplotypes, on chromosomes 7, 14, 16 and 17, were confirmed in Swedish
      familial cancer cases. It was possible to perform exome sequencing in one patient
      for each of those four loci. No clear disease-causing exonic mutation was found
      in any of the four loci. Some of the candidate loci hold several cancer genes,
      suggesting that the risk associated with one locus could involve more than one
      gene associated with cancer risk. In summary, this study identified seven novel
      candidate loci associated with cancer risk. It was also suggested that cancer
      risk at one locus could depend on multiple contributing risk mutations/genes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Taxane containing chemotherapy extends survival for breast cancer
      patients. However, taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN) cannot be
      predicted, prevented or effectively treated. Using genome-wide analyses, we
      sought to identify common risk variants for TIPN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women
      with high-risk breast cancer enrolled in SWOG 0221 were genotyped using the
      Illumina 1M chip. Genome-wide analyses were performed in relation to >/=grade 3
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) neuropathy in European and
      African Americans. Data were meta-analyzed with GW associations of CTCAE >/=grade
      3 versus <grade 3 in CALGB 40101 assuming a fixed effects model. RESULTS: The
      percentage of >/=grade 3 TIPN in 1269 European Americans and 139 African
      Americans in S0221, was 11.6 and 22.3%, respectively. CALGB 40101 >/=grade 3 TOPN
      was 7.2%. The most significant association with >/=grade 3 TIPN was the G allele 
      of rs1858826 in GNGT1 (Pmeta=1.1x10), which showed a decrease in risk of >/=grade
      3 TIPN (odds ratio=0.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.46). CONCLUSION: The
      genetic variants associated with >/=grade 3 TIPN are hypothesized to have
      biochemical functions and reside in and near genes involved in diabetes and
      diabetic neuropathy. This finding is consistent with results from CALGB 40101
      pathway analyses. Larger homogeneous trials with similar dosing and criteria for 
      defining neuropathy are needed to properly assess the relationship of genomics
      with the neuropathy spectrum.

TI  - Bayesian and frequentist analysis of an Austrian genome-wide association study of
      colorectal cancer and advanced adenomas.
PG  - 98623-98634
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.21697 [doi]
AB  - Most genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were analyzed using single marker
      tests in combination with stringent correction procedures for multiple testing.
      Thus, a substantial proportion of associated single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) remained undetected and may account for missing heritability in complex
      traits. Model selection procedures present a powerful alternative to identify
      associated SNPs in high-dimensional settings. In this GWAS including 1060
      colorectal cancer cases, 689 cases of advanced colorectal adenomas and 4367
      controls we pursued a dual approach to investigate genome-wide associations with 
      disease risk applying both, single marker analysis and model selection based on
      the modified Bayesian information criterion, mBIC2, implemented in the software
      package MOSGWA. For different case-control comparisons, we report models
      including between 1-14 candidate SNPs. A genome-wide significant association of
      rs17659990 (P=5.43x10(-9), DOCK3, chromosome 3p21.2) with colorectal cancer risk 
      was observed. Furthermore, 56 SNPs known to influence susceptibility to
      colorectal cancer and advanced adenoma were tested in a hypothesis-driven
      approach and several of them were found to be relevant in our Austrian cohort.
      After correction for multiple testing (alpha=8.9x10(-4)), the most significant
      associations were observed for SNPs rs10505477 (P=6.08x10(-4)) and rs6983267
      (P=7.35x10(-4)) of CASC8, rs3802842 (P=8.98x10(-5), COLCA1,2), and rs12953717
      (P=4.64x10(-4), SMAD7). All previously unreported SNPs demand replication in
      additional samples. Reanalysis of existing GWAS datasets using model selection as
      tool to detect SNPs associated with a complex trait may present a promising
      resource to identify further genetic risk variants not only for colorectal
      cancer.

TI  - Two Novel Susceptibility Loci for Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djx084 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer incidence is 1.6-fold higher in African Americans than in other
      populations. The risk factors that drive this disparity are unknown and
      potentially consist of social, environmental, and genetic influences. To
      investigate the genetic basis of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry, we
      performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis using two-sided statistical
      tests in 10 202 case subjects and 10 810 control subjects. We identified novel
      signals on chromosomes 13q34 and 22q12, with the risk-associated alleles found
      only in men of African ancestry (13q34: rs75823044, risk allele frequency = 2.2%,
      odds ratio [OR] = 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37 to 1.76, P = 6.10 x
      10-12; 22q12.1: rs78554043, risk allele frequency = 1.5%, OR = 1.62, 95% CI =
      1.39 to 1.89, P = 7.50 x 10-10). At 13q34, the signal is located 5' of the gene
      IRS2 and 3' of a long noncoding RNA, while at 22q12 the candidate functional
      allele is a missense variant in the CHEK2 gene. These findings provide further
      support for the role of ancestry-specific germline variation in contributing to
      population differences in prostate cancer risk.

TI  - Association analysis identifies 65 new breast cancer risk loci.
PG  - 92-94
LID - 10.1038/nature24284 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer risk is influenced by rare coding variants in susceptibility genes,
      such as BRCA1, and many common, mostly non-coding variants. However, much of the 
      genetic contribution to breast cancer risk remains unknown. Here we report the
      results of a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 
      105,974 controls of European ancestry and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of
      East Asian ancestry. We identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall
      breast cancer risk at P < 5 x 10(-8). The majority of credible risk
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms in these loci fall in distal regulatory elements,
      and by integrating in silico data to predict target genes in breast cells at each
      locus, we demonstrate a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic
      driver genes in breast tumours. We also find that heritability of breast cancer
      due to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory features was 2-5-fold
      enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with strong enrichment for
      particular transcription factor binding sites. These results provide further
      insight into genetic susceptibility to breast cancer and will improve the use of 
      genetic risk scores for individualized screening and prevention.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study to Identify Susceptibility Loci That Modify
      Radiation-Related Risk for Breast Cancer After Childhood Cancer.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djx058 [doi]
AB  - Background: Childhood cancer survivors treated with chest-directed radiotherapy
      have substantially elevated risk for developing breast cancer. Although genetic
      susceptibility to breast cancer in the general population is well studied,
      large-scale evaluation of breast cancer susceptibility after chest-directed
      radiotherapy for childhood cancer is lacking. Methods: We conducted a genome-wide
      association study of breast cancer in female survivors of childhood cancer,
      pooling two cohorts with detailed treatment data and systematic, long-term
      follow-up: the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and St. Jude Lifetime Cohort. The 
      study population comprised 207 survivors who developed breast cancer and 2774 who
      had not developed any subsequent neoplasm as of last follow-up. Genotyping and
      subsequent imputation yielded 16 958 466 high-quality variants for analysis. We
      tested associations in the overall population and in subgroups stratified by
      receipt of lower than 10 and 10 or higher gray breast radiation exposure. We
      report P values and pooled per-allele risk estimates from Cox proportional
      hazards regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Among
      survivors who received 10 or higher gray breast radiation exposure, a locus on
      1q41 was associated with subsequent breast cancer risk (rs4342822, nearest gene
      PROX1 , risk allele frequency in control subjects [RAF controls ] = 0.46, hazard 
      ratio = 1.92, 95% confidence interval = 1.49 to 2.44, P = 7.09 x 10 -9 ). Two
      rare variants also showed potentially promising associations (breast radiation
      >/=10 gray: rs74949440, 11q23, TAGLN , RAF controls = 0.02, P = 5.84 x 10 -8 ;
      <10 gray: rs17020562, 1q32.3, RPS6KC1 , RAF controls = 0.0005, P = 6.68 x 10 -8
      ). Associations were restricted to these dose subgroups, with consistent findings
      in the two survivor cohorts. Conclusions: Our study provides strong evidence that
      germline genetics outside high-risk syndromes could modify the effect of
      radiation exposure on breast cancer risk after childhood cancer.

TI  - Identification of ten variants associated with risk of estrogen-receptor-negative
      breast cancer.
PG  - 1767-1778
LID - 10.1038/ng.3785 [doi]
AB  - Most common breast cancer susceptibility variants have been identified through
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of predominantly estrogen receptor
      (ER)-positive disease. We conducted a GWAS using 21,468 ER-negative cases and
      100,594 controls combined with 18,908 BRCA1 mutation carriers (9,414 with breast 
      cancer), all of European origin. We identified independent associations at P < 5 
      x 10(-8) with ten variants at nine new loci. At P < 0.05, we replicated
      associations with 10 of 11 variants previously reported in ER-negative disease or
      BRCA1 mutation carrier GWAS and observed consistent associations with ER-negative
      disease for 105 susceptibility variants identified by other studies. These 125
      variants explain approximately 16% of the familial risk of this breast cancer
      subtype. There was high genetic correlation (0.72) between risk of ER-negative
      breast cancer and breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers. These findings 
      may lead to improved risk prediction and inform further fine-mapping and
      functional work to better understand the biological basis of ER-negative breast
      cancer.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have been successful in elucidating the genetic
      basis of colorectal cancer (CRC), but there remains unexplained variability in
      genetic risk. To identify new risk variants and to confirm reported associations,
      we conducted a genome-wide association study in 1,701 CRC cases and 14,082
      cancer-free controls from the Finnish population. A total of 9,068,015 genetic
      variants were imputed and tested, and 30 promising variants were studied in
      additional 11,647 cases and 12,356 controls of European ancestry. The previously 
      reported association between the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs992157
      (2q35) and CRC was independently replicated (p = 2.08 x 10(-4) ; OR, 1.14; 95%
      CI, 1.06-1.23), and it was genome-wide significant in combined analysis (p = 1.50
      x 10(-9) ; OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.16). Variants at 2q35, 6p21.2, 8q23.3,
      8q24.21, 10q22.3, 10q24.2, 11q13.4, 11q23.1, 14q22.2, 15q13.3, 18q21.1, 20p12.3
      and 20q13.33 were associated with CRC in the Finnish population (false discovery 
      rate < 0.1), but new risk loci were not found. These results replicate the
      effects of multiple loci on the risk of CRC and identify shared risk alleles
      between the Finnish population isolate and outbred populations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated
      with progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced
      stage serous EOC. METHODS: Patients enrolled in GOG-172 and 182 who provided
      specimens for translational research and consent were included. Germline DNA was 
      evaluated with the Illumina's HumanOMNI1-Quad beadchips and scanned using
      Illumina's iScan optical imaging system. SNPs with allele frequency>0.05 and
      genotyping rate>0.98 were included. Analysis of SNPs for PFS and OS was done
      using Cox regression. Statistical significance was determined using Bonferroni
      corrected p-values with genomic control adjustment. RESULTS: The initial GWAS
      analysis included 1,124,677 markers in 396 patients. To obtain the final data
      set, quality control checks were performed and limited to serous tumors and
      self-identified Caucasian race. In total 636,555 SNPs and 289 patients passed all
      the filters. The pre-specified statistical level of significance was 7.855e(-08).
      No SNPs met this criteria for PFS or OS, however, two SNPs were close to
      significance (rs10899426 p-2.144e(-)(08)) (rs6256 p-9.774e(-07)) for PFS and 2
      different SNPs were identified (rs295315 p-7.536e(-)(07); rs17693104
      p-7.734e(-)(07)) which were close to significance for OS. CONCLUSIONS: Using the 
      pre-specified level of significance of 1x10(-08), we did not identify any SNPs of
      statistical significance for OS or PFS, however several were close. The SNP's
      identified in this GWAS study will require validation and these preliminary
      findings may lead to identification of novel pathways and biomarkers.

TI  - Japanese genome-wide association study identifies a significant colorectal cancer
      susceptibility locus at chromosome 10p14.
PG  - 2239-2247
LID - 10.1111/cas.13391 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies are a powerful tool for searching for disease
      susceptibility loci. Several studies identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNP) connected intimately to the onset of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been
      published, but there are few reports of genome-wide association studies in Japan.
      To identify genetic variants that modify the risk of CRC oncogenesis, especially 
      in the Japanese population, we performed a multi-stage genome-wide association
      study using a large number of samples: 1846 CRC cases and 2675 controls. We
      identified 4 SNP (rs7912831, rs4749812, rs7898455 and rs10905453) in chromosome
      region 10p14 associated with CRC; however, there are no coding or non-coding
      genes within this region of fairly extensive linkage disequilibrium (a 500-kb
      block) on 10p14. Our study revealed that the 10p14 locus is significantly
      correlated with susceptibility to CRC in the Japanese population, in accordance
      with the results of multiple studies in other races.

AB  - Background: Few studies have focused on the relationship of exonic variation with
      breast cancer and subtypes defined by tumor markers: estrogen receptor (ER),
      progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2.Methods: We genotyped 1,764 breast cancer
      patients and 1,400 controls from the California Teachers Study cohort using the
      Infinium HumanExome Beadchip. Individual variant and gene-based analyses were
      conducted for overall breast cancer and by individual tumor marker
      subtype.Results: No exonic variants or gene-based analyses were statistically
      significantly associated with breast cancer overall or by ER-, PR-, or
      HER2-defined subtype.Conclusions: We did not detect any novel statistically
      significant exonic variants with overall breast cancer risk or by subtype.Impact:
      Exonic variants in the exome chip may not be associated with overall breast
      cancer or subtype susceptibility. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(9);

TI  - Defining the genetic susceptibility to cervical neoplasia-A genome-wide
      association study.
PG  - e1006866
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006866 [doi]
AB  - A small percentage of women with cervical HPV infection progress to cervical
      neoplasia, and the risk factors determining progression are incompletely
      understood. We sought to define the genetic loci involved in cervical neoplasia
      and to assess its heritability using unbiased unrelated case/control statistical 
      approaches. We demonstrated strong association of cervical neoplasia with risk
      and protective HLA haplotypes that are determined by the amino-acids carried at
      positions 13 and 71 in pocket 4 of HLA-DRB1 and position 156 in HLA-B.
      Furthermore, 36% (standard error 2.4%) of liability of HPV-associated cervical
      pre-cancer and cancer is determined by common genetic variants. Women in the
      highest 10% of genetic risk scores have approximately >7.1% risk, and those in
      the highest 5% have approximately >21.6% risk, of developing cervical neoplasia. 
      Future studies should examine genetic risk prediction in assessing the risk of
      cervical neoplasia further, in combination with other screening methods.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The major clinical side effect of the ERBB2-targeted breast cancer
      therapy, trastuzumab, is a decline in the left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF). Improved markers are needed to better identify patients susceptible to
      cardiotoxicity. METHODS: The NCCTG N9831 trial compared adjuvant doxorubicin and 
      cyclophosphamide followed by either weekly paclitaxel (arm A); paclitaxel then
      trastuzumab (arm B); or concurrent paclitaxel and trastuzumab (arm C) in patients
      with HER2-positive breast cancer. A genome-wide association study was performed
      on all patients with available DNA (N=1446). We used linear regression to
      identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with decline in LVEF, 
      adjusting for age, baseline LVEF, antihypertensive medications, and the first two
      principle components. RESULTS: In total, 618 863 SNPs passed quality control and 
      DNA from 1191 patients passed genotyping quality control and were identified as
      Whites of non-Hispanic origin. SNPs at six loci were associated with a decline in
      LVEF (P=7.73x10 to 8.93x10), LDB2, BRINP1, chr6 intergenic, RAB22A, TRPC6, and
      LINC01060, in patients who received chemotherapy plus trastuzumab (arms BC,
      N=800). None of these loci were significant in patients who received chemotherapy
      only (arm A, N=391) and did not increase in significance in the combined analysis
      of all patients. We did not observe association, P<0.05, with SNPs previously
      associated with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity at ERBB2, I655V, and P1170A.
      We replicated association, P<0.05, with SNPs previously associated with
      anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity at CBR3 and ABCB1. CONCLUSION: Our study
      identified six putative novel cardiotoxicity loci in patients treated with
      combination chemotherapy and trastuzumab that require further investigation and
      confirmed known associations of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

AB  - Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer in Korea. Several susceptibility loci of
      differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) were identified by previous genome-wide
      association studies (GWASs) in Europeans only. Here we conducted a GWAS and a
      replication study in Koreans using a total of 1,085 DTC cases and 8,884 controls,
      and validated these results using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)
      analysis and clinical phenotypes. The most robust associations were observed in
      the NRG1 gene (rs6996585, P=1.08 x 10(-10)) and this SNP was also associated with
      NRG1 expression in thyroid tissues. In addition, we confirmed three previously
      reported loci (FOXE1, NKX2-1 and DIRC3) and identified seven novel susceptibility
      loci (VAV3, PCNXL2, INSR, MRSB3, FHIT, SEPT11 and SLC24A6) associated with DTC.
      Furthermore, we identified specific variants of DTC that have different effects
      according to cancer type or ethnicity. Our findings provide deeper insight into
      the genetic contribution to thyroid cancer in different populations.

      results from the SIGNAL/PHARE clinical cohort.

AB  - Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer is a subtype of
      interest regarding its outcome and the impressive impact of human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 targeted therapy. Constitutional variants may be
      involved in the aetiology of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive
      breast cancer, and we propose a case-case study to test the hypothesis that
      single nucleotide polymorphisms may be associated with human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 status. A Genome-Wide Association Study was used in a cohort of
      9836 patients from the SIGNAL/PHARE study (NCT00381901-RECF1098). The main goal
      was to identify variants specifically related to human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2-positive breast cancer. A two-staged genotyping strategy was carried
      out to cover as large a proportion of the genome as possible. All subjects were
      genotyped using the Illumina HumanCore Exome chip set. Principal Components
      Analysis and k-means were then used to characterize the ancestry of the
      participants. A random sample of subjects from the main "European" cluster was
      genotyped with the Omni5 chip set. These data were then used to impute missing
      genotypes from the remaining subjects genotyped only using the HumanCore Exome
      array. From the 9836 patients, a total of 8703 cases including 3230 patients with
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer were analyzed.
      Despite having 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.23 in this population, no
      variant achieved genome-wide significance for association with the occurrence of 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer vs. any other
      subtype of breast tumour. Our study was unable to identify constitutional
      polymorphisms that are strongly associated with human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2-positive status among breast cancer patients.

TI  - Large-scale association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci
      and heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across histological subtypes.
PG  - 1126-1132
LID - 10.1038/ng.3892 [doi]
AB  - Although several lung cancer susceptibility loci have been identified, much of
      the heritability for lung cancer remains unexplained. Here 14,803 cases and
      12,262 controls of European descent were genotyped on the OncoArray and combined 
      with existing data for an aggregated genome-wide association study (GWAS)
      analysis of lung cancer in 29,266 cases and 56,450 controls. We identified 18
      susceptibility loci achieving genome-wide significance, including 10 new loci.
      The new loci highlight the striking heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility
      across the histological subtypes of lung cancer, with four loci associated with
      lung cancer overall and six loci associated with lung adenocarcinoma. Gene
      expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis in 1,425 normal lung tissue
      samples highlights RNASET2, SECISBP2L and NRG1 as candidate genes. Other loci
      include genes such as a cholinergic nicotinic receptor, CHRNA2, and the
      telomere-related genes OFBC1 and RTEL1. Further exploration of the target genes
      will continue to provide new insights into the etiology of lung cancer.

AB  - Previous findings on the association of genetic factors and pancreatic cancer
      survival are limited and inconsistent. In a two-stage study, we analyzed the
      existing genome-wide association study dataset of 868 pancreatic cancer patients 
      from MD Anderson Cancer Center in relation to overall survival using Cox
      regression. Top hits were selected for replication in another 820 patients from
      the same institution using the Taqman genotyping method. Functional annotation,
      pathway analysis and gene expression analysis were conducted using existing
      software and databases. We discovered genome-wide significant associations of
      patient survival with three imputed SNPs which, in complete LD (r(2) = 1), were
      intronic SNPs of the PAIP2B (rs113988120) and DYSF genes (rs112493246 and
      rs138529893) located on Chromosome 2. The variant alleles were associated with a 
      3.06-fold higher risk of death [95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.10-4.47, p=6.4 x
      10-9] after adjusting for clinical factors. Eleven SNPs were tested in the
      replication study and the association of rs113988120 with survival was confirmed 
      (hazard ratio: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.13-2.20, p=0.008). In silico analysis found
      rs1139988120 might lead to altered motif. This locus is in LD (D' = 0.77) with
      three eQTL SNPs near or belong to the NAGK and MCEE genes. According to The
      Cancer Genome Atlas data and our previous RNA-sequencing data, the mRNA
      expression level of PAIP2B but not NAGK, MCEE or DYSF was significantly lower in 
      pancreatic tumors than in normal adjacent tissues. Additional validation efforts 
      and functional studies are warranted to demonstrate whether PAIP2B is a novel
      tumor suppressor gene and a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.

TI  - SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and plasma estrone conjugates in postmenopausal women with 
      ER+ breast cancer: genome-wide association studies of the estrone pathway.
PG  - 189-199
LID - 10.1007/s10549-017-4243-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Estrone (E1), the major circulating estrogen in postmenopausal women,
      promotes estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) breast tumor growth and proliferation. 
      Two major reactions contribute to E1 plasma concentrations, aromatase (CYP19A1)
      catalyzed E1 synthesis from androstenedione and steroid sulfatase (STS) catalyzed
      hydrolysis of estrone conjugates (E1Cs). E1Cs have been associated with breast
      cancer risk and may contribute to tumor progression since STS is expressed in
      breast cancer where its activity exceeds that of aromatase. METHODS: We performed
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify SNPs associated with variation
      in plasma concentrations of E1Cs, E1, and androstenedione in 774 postmenopausal
      women with resected early-stage ER+ breast cancer. Hormone concentrations were
      measured prior to aromatase inhibitor therapy. RESULTS: Multiple SNPs in SLCO1B1,
      a gene encoding a hepatic influx transporter, displayed genome-wide significant
      associations with E1C plasma concentrations and with the E1C/E1 ratio. The top
      SNP for E1C concentrations, rs4149056 (p = 3.74E-11), was a missense variant that
      results in reduced transporter activity. Patients homozygous for the variant
      allele had significantly higher average E1C plasma concentrations than did other 
      patients. Furthermore, three other SLCO1B1 SNPs, not in LD with rs4149056, were
      associated with both E1C concentrations and the E1C/E1 ratio and were cis-eQTLs
      for SLCO1B3. GWAS signals of suggestive significance were also observed for E1,
      androstenedione, and the E1/androstenedione ratio. CONCLUSION: These results
      suggest a mechanism for genetic variation in E1C plasma concentrations as well as
      possible SNP biomarkers to identify ER+ breast cancer patients for whom STS
      inhibitors might be of clinical value.

TI  - Identification of 12 new susceptibility loci for different histotypes of
      epithelial ovarian cancer.
PG  - 680-691
LID - 10.1038/ng.3826 [doi]
AB  - To identify common alleles associated with different histotypes of epithelial
      ovarian cancer (EOC), we pooled data from multiple genome-wide genotyping
      projects totaling 25,509 EOC cases and 40,941 controls. We identified nine new
      susceptibility loci for different EOC histotypes: six for serous EOC histotypes
      (3q28, 4q32.3, 8q21.11, 10q24.33, 18q11.2 and 22q12.1), two for mucinous EOC
      (3q22.3 and 9q31.1) and one for endometrioid EOC (5q12.3). We then performed
      meta-analysis on the results for high-grade serous ovarian cancer with the
      results from analysis of 31,448 BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, including
      3,887 mutation carriers with EOC. This identified three additional susceptibility
      loci at 2q13, 8q24.1 and 12q24.31. Integrated analyses of genes and regulatory
      biofeatures at each locus predicted candidate susceptibility genes, including
      OBFC1, a new candidate susceptibility gene for low-grade and borderline serous
      EOC.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in ethnic/racial minority populations can 
      help to fine-map previously identified risk regions or discover new risk loci
      because of the genetic diversity in these populations. We conducted a GWAS of
      colorectal cancer (CRC) in 6,597 African Americans (1,894 cases and 4,703
      controls) (Stage 1) and followed up the most promising markers in a replication
      set of 2,041 participants of African descent (891 cases and 1,150 controls)
      (Stage 2). We identified a novel variant, rs56848936 in the gene SYMPK at
      19q13.3, associated with colon cancer risk (odds ratio 0.61 for the risk allele
      G, p = 2.4 x 10(-8) ). The frequency of the G allele was 0.06 in African
      Americans, compared to <0.01 in Europeans, Asians and Amerindians in the 1000
      Genomes project. In addition, a variant previously identified through
      fine-mapping in this GWAS in the region 19q13.1, rs7252505, was confirmed to be
      more strongly associated with CRC in the African American replication set than
      the variant originally reported in Europeans (rs10411210). The association
      between rs7252505 and CRC was of borderline significance (p = 0.05) in a Hispanic
      population GWAS with 1,611 CRC cases and 4,330 controls. With the three datasets 
      combined, the odds ratio was 0.84 for the risk allele A (95% confidence interval 
      0.79-0.89, p = 3.7 x 10(-8) ). This study further highlights the importance of
      conducting GWAS studies in diverse ancestry populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer is highly lethal, with notable differences in
      incidence by geography and ethnic background. The aim of this study was to
      identify common genetic susceptibility alleles for gallbladder cancer. METHODS:
      In this case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS), we did a genome-wide
      scan of gallbladder cancer cases and hospital visitor controls, both of Indian
      descent, followed by imputation across the genome. Cases were patients aged 20-80
      years with microscopically confirmed primary gallbladder cancer diagnosed or
      treated at Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India, and enrolled in the study
      between Sept 12, 2010, and June 8, 2015. We only included patients who had been
      diagnosed less than 1 year before the date of enrolment and excluded patients
      with any other malignancies. We recruited visitor controls aged 20-80 years with 
      no history of cancer visiting all departments or units of Tata Memorial Hospital 
      during the same time period and frequency matched them to cases on the basis of
      age, sex, and current region of residence. We estimated association using
      logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, and five eigenvectors. We recruited 
      samples for a replication cohort from patients visiting Tata Memorial Hospital
      between Aug 4, 2015, and May 17, 2016, and patients visiting the Sanjay Gandhi
      Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India, between July, 2010,
      and May, 2015. We used the same inclusion and exclusion criteria for the
      replication set. We examined three of the most significant single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in the replication cohort and did a meta-analysis of the
      GWAS discovery and replication sets to get combined estimates of association.
      FINDINGS: The discovery cohort comprised 1042 gallbladder cancer cases and 1709
      controls and the replication cohort contained 428 gallbladder cancer cases and
      420 controls. We observed genome-wide significant associations for several
      markers in the chromosomal region 7q21.12 harbouring both the ABCB1 and ABCB4
      genes, with the most notable SNPs after replication and meta-analysis being
      rs1558375 (GWAS p=3.8 x 10(-9); replication p=0.01; combined p=2.3 x 10(-10));
      rs17209837 (GWAS p=2.0 x 10(-8); replication p=0.02; combined p=2.3 x 10(-9)),
      and rs4148808 (GWAS p=2.4 x 10(-8); replication p=0.008; combined p=2.7 x
      10(-9)). Combined estimates of per-allele trend odds ratios were 1.47 (95% CI
      1.30-1.66; p=2.31 x 10(-10)) for rs1558375, 1.61 (1.38-1.89; p=2.26 x 10(-9)) for
      rs17209837, and 1.57 (1.35-1.82; p=2.71 x 10(-9)) for rs4148808. GWAS
      heritability analysis suggested that common variants are associated with
      substantial variation in risk of gallbladder cancer (sibling relative risk 3.15
      [95% CI 1.80-5.49]). INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this study is the first
      report of common genetic variation conferring gallbladder cancer risk at
      genome-wide significance. This finding, along with in-silico and biological
      evidence indicating the potential functional significance of ABCB1 and ABCB4,
      underlines the likely importance of these hepatobiliary phospholipid transporter 
      genes in the pathology of gallbladder cancer. FUNDING: The Tata Memorial Centre
      and Department of Biotechnology.

AB  - The great majority of thyroid cancers are of the non-medullary type. Here we
      report findings from a genome-wide association study of non-medullary thyroid
      cancer, including in total 3,001 patients and 287,550 controls from five study
      groups of European descent. Our results yield five novel loci (all with
      Pcombined<3 x 10(-8)): 1q42.2 (rs12129938 in PCNXL2), 3q26.2 (rs6793295 a
      missense mutation in LRCC34 near TERC), 5q22.1 (rs73227498 between NREP and
      EPB41L4A), 10q24.33 (rs7902587 near OBFC1), and two independently associated
      variants at 15q22.33 (rs2289261 and rs56062135; both in SMAD3). We also confirm
      recently published association results from a Chinese study of a variant on
      5p15.33 (rs2736100 near the TERT gene) and present a stronger association result 
      for a moderately correlated variant (rs10069690; OR=1.20, P=3.2 x 10(-7)) based
      on our study of individuals of European ancestry. In combination, these results
      raise several opportunities for future studies of the pathogenesis of thyroid
      cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide association studies in women of African ancestry identified 3q26.21
      as a novel susceptibility locus for oestrogen receptor negative breast cancer.
PG  - 4835-4846
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddw305 [doi]
AB  - Multiple breast cancer loci have been identified in previous genome-wide
      association studies, but they were mainly conducted in populations of European
      ancestry. Women of African ancestry are more likely to have young-onset and
      oestrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer for reasons that are unknown and
      understudied. To identify genetic risk factors for breast cancer in women of
      African descent, we conducted a meta-analysis of two genome-wide association
      studies of breast cancer; one study consists of 1,657 cases and 2,029 controls
      genotyped with Illumina's HumanOmni2.5 BeadChip and the other study included
      3,016 cases and 2,745 controls genotyped using Illumina Human1M-Duo BeadChip. The
      top 18,376 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from the meta-analysis were
      replicated in the third study that consists of 1,984 African Americans cases and 
      2,939 controls. We found that SNP rs13074711, 26.5 Kb upstream of TNFSF10 at
      3q26.21, was significantly associated with risk of oestrogen receptor
      (ER)-negative breast cancer (odds ratio [OR]=1.29, 95% CI: 1.18-1.40; P = 1.8 x
      10 - 8). Functional annotations suggest that the TNFSF10 gene may be involved in 
      breast cancer aetiology, but further functional experiments are needed. In
      addition, we confirmed SNP rs10069690 was the best indicator for ER-negative
      breast cancer at 5p15.33 (OR = 1.30; P = 2.4 x 10 - 10) and identified rs12998806
      as the best indicator for ER-positive breast cancer at 2q35 (OR = 1.34; P = 2.2 x
      10 - 8) for women of African ancestry. These findings demonstrated additional
      susceptibility alleles for breast cancer can be revealed in diverse populations
      and have important public health implications in building race/ethnicity-specific
      risk prediction model for breast cancer.

AB  - To identify genomic markers associated with the response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with cervical cancer, we performed a three-stage 
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the Han Chinese population. A total of
      596 patients with stage IA2-IIIB cervical cancer were enrolled in this study. One
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs6812281, per allele OR = 2.37, P = 9.0 x 
      10(-9)) located at 4q34.3 reached GWAS significance (P < 5.0 x 10(-8)). Another
      three SNPs, rs4590782 (10q26.2, P = 1.59 x 10(-5), per allele OR = 0.48),
      rs1742101 (14q32.11, P = 7.11 x 10(-6), per allele OR = 0.52), and rs1364121
      (16q23.3, P = 3.15 x 10(-6), per allele OR = 1.98), exhibited strong evidence of 
      associations with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with a C allele 
      (CT + CC) of rs4590782 had better 5-year overall survival rates (82.9% vs. 75.8%,
      P = 0.083) and 5-year disease-free survival rate (80.8% vs. 72.7%, P = 0.021)
      than those without a C allele. Our findings help to characterize the genetic
      etiology of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with cervical
      cancer.

AB  - There is strong evidence for a role of environmental risk factors involved in
      susceptibility to develop multiple keratinocyte cancers (mKCs), but whether genes
      are also involved in mKCs susceptibility has not been thoroughly investigated. We
      investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with
      susceptibility for mKCs. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,666 cases
      with mKCs and 1,950 cases with single KC (sKCs; controls) from Harvard cohorts
      (the Nurses' Health Study [NHS], NHS II, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up
      Study) and the Framingham Heart Study was carried-out using over 8 million SNPs
      (stage-1). We sought to replicate the most significant statistical associations
      (p-value</= 5.5x10-6) in an independent cohort of 574 mKCs and 872 sKCs from the 
      Rotterdam Study. In the discovery stage, 40 SNPs with suggestive associations
      (p-value </=5.5x10-6) were identified, with eight independent SNPs tagging all 40
      SNPs. The most significant SNP was located at chromosome 9 (rs7468390; p-value = 
      3.92x10-7). In stage-2, none of these SNPs replicated and only two of them were
      associated with mKCs in the same direction in the combined meta-analysis. We
      tested the associations for 19 previously reported basal cell carcinoma-related
      SNPs (candidate gene association analysis), and found that rs1805007 (MC1R locus)
      was significantly associated with risk of mKCs (p-value = 2.80x10-4). Although
      the suggestive SNPs with susceptibility for mKCs were not replicated, we found
      that previously identified BCC variants may also be associated with mKC, which
      the most significant association (rs1805007) located at the MC1R gene.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been a number of candidate gene association studies of
      cancer cachexia-related traits, but no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has
      been published to date. Cachexia presents in patients with a number of complex
      traits, including both cancer and COPD. The objective of the current
      investigation was to search for a shared genetic aetiology for change in body
      mass index (DeltaBMI) among cancer and COPD by using GWAS data in the Framingham 
      Heart Study. METHODS: A linear mixed effects model accounting for age, sex, and
      change in smoking status was used to calculate DeltaBMI in participants over 40
      years of age with three consecutive BMI time points (n = 4162). Four GWAS of
      DeltaBMI using generalized estimating equations were performed among 1085
      participants with a cancer diagnosis, 204 with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, 112 
      with lung cancer, and 237 with COPD to test for association with 418 365
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RESULTS: Two SNPs reached a level of
      genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8) ) with DeltaBMI: (i) rs41526344 within
      the CNTN4 gene, among COPD cases (beta = 0.13, P = 4.3 x 10(-8) ); and (ii)
      rs4751240 in the gene Dedicator of Cytokinesis 1 (DOCK1) among GI cancer cases
      (beta = 0.10, P = 1.9 x 10(-8) ). The DOCK1 SNP association replicated in the
      DeltaBMI GWAS among COPD cases (betameta-analyis = 0.10, Pmeta-analyis = 9.3 x
      10(-10) ). The DOCK1 gene codes for the dedicator of cytokinesis 1 protein, which
      has a role in myoblast fusion. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, one statistically significant
      common variant in the DOCK1 gene was associated with DeltaBMI in GI cancer and
      COPD cases providing support for at least partially shared aetiology of DeltaBMI 
      in complex diseases.

AB  - Genetic polymorphisms are associated with breast cancer risk. Clinical and
      epidemiological observations suggest that clinical characteristics of breast
      cancer, such as estrogen receptor or HER2 status, are also influenced by
      hereditary factors. To identify genetic variants associated with pathological
      characteristics of breast cancer patients, a Genome Wide Association Study was
      performed in a cohort of 9365 women from the French nationwide SIGNAL/PHARE
      studies (NCT00381901/RECF1098). Strong association between the FGFR2 locus and ER
      status of breast cancer patients was observed (ER-positive n=6211, ER-negative
      n=2516; rs3135718 OR=1.34 p=5.46x10-12). This association was limited to patients
      with HER2-negative tumors (ER-positive n=4267, ER-negative n=1185; rs3135724
      OR=1.85 p=1.16x10-11). The FGFR2 locus is known to be associated with breast
      cancer risk. This study provides sound evidence for an association between
      variants in the FGFR2 locus and ER status among breast cancer patients,
      particularly among patients with HER2-negative disease. This refinement of the
      association between FGFR2 variants and ER-status to HER2-negative disease
      provides novel insight to potential biological and clinical influence of genetic 
      polymorphisms on breast tumors.

      Basis for the Response of Breast Cancer Patients to Aromatase Inhibitor Therapy.
PG  - 7012-7023
AB  - Genetic risks in breast cancer remain only partly understood. Here, we report the
      results of a genome-wide association study of germline DNA from 4,658 women,
      including 252 women experiencing a breast cancer recurrence, who were entered on 
      the MA.27 adjuvant trial comparing the aromatase inhibitors (AI) anastrozole and 
      exemestane. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of top significance were
      identified in the gene encoding MIR2052HG, a long noncoding RNA of unknown
      function. Heterozygous or homozygous individuals for variant alleles exhibited a 
      approximately 40% or approximately 63% decrease, respectively, in the hazard of
      breast cancer recurrence relative to homozygous wild-type individuals. Functional
      genomic studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines and ERalpha-positive breast cancer
      cell lines showed that expression from MIR2052HG and the ESR1 gene encoding
      estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) was induced by estrogen and AI in a
      SNP-dependent manner. Variant SNP genotypes exhibited increased ERalpha binding
      to estrogen response elements, relative to wild-type genotypes, a pattern that
      was reversed by AI treatment. Further, variant SNPs were associated with lower
      expression of MIR2052HG and ERalpha. RNAi-mediated silencing of MIR2052HG in
      breast cancer cell lines decreased ERalpha expression, cell proliferation, and
      anchorage-independent colony formation. Mechanistic investigations revealed that 
      MIR2052HG sustained ERalpha levels both by promoting AKT/FOXO3-mediated ESR1
      transcription and by limiting ubiquitin-mediated, proteasome-dependent
      degradation of ERalpha. Taken together, our results define MIR2052HS as a
      functionally polymorphic gene that affects risks of breast cancer recurrence in
      women treated with AI. More broadly, our results offer a pharmacogenomic basis to
      understand differences in the response of breast cancer patients to AI therapy.

AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer
      in 6,034 cases and 6,585 controls from Europe, North America and South America.
      We detected eight significantly associated loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)), seven of which 
      are new for these cancer sites. Oral and pharyngeal cancers combined were
      associated with loci at 6p21.32 (rs3828805, HLA-DQB1), 10q26.13 (rs201982221,
      LHPP) and 11p15.4 (rs1453414, OR52N2-TRIM5). Oral cancer was associated with two 
      new regions, 2p23.3 (rs6547741, GPN1) and 9q34.12 (rs928674, LAMC3), and with
      known cancer-related loci-9p21.3 (rs8181047, CDKN2B-AS1) and 5p15.33 (rs10462706,
      CLPTM1L). Oropharyngeal cancer associations were limited to the human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) region, and classical HLA allele imputation showed a protective
      association with the class II haplotype HLA-DRB1*1301-HLA-DQA1*0103-HLA-DQB1*0603
      (odds ratio (OR) = 0.59, P = 2.7 x 10(-9)). Stratified analyses on a subgroup of 
      oropharyngeal cases with information available on human papillomavirus (HPV)
      status indicated that this association was considerably stronger in HPV-positive 
      (OR = 0.23, P = 1.6 x 10(-6)) than in HPV-negative (OR = 0.75, P = 0.16) cancers.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006296 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many genetic
      susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, variants in these loci 
      explain only a small proportion of familial aggregation, and there are likely
      additional variants that are associated with CRC susceptibility. Genome-wide
      studies of gene-environment interactions may identify variants that are not
      detected in GWAS of marginal gene effects. To study this, we conducted a
      genome-wide analysis for interaction between genetic variants and alcohol
      consumption and cigarette smoking using data from the Colon Cancer Family
      Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium
      (GECCO). Interactions were tested using logistic regression. We identified
      interaction between CRC risk and alcohol consumption and variants in the
      9q22.32/HIATL1 (Pinteraction = 1.76x10-8; permuted p-value 3.51x10-8) region.
      Compared to non-/occasional drinking light to moderate alcohol consumption was
      associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with
      rs9409565 CT genotype (OR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.74-0.91]; P = 2.1x10-4) and TT
      genotypes (OR,0.62 [95% CI, 0.51-0.75]; P = 1.3x10-6) but not associated among
      those with the CC genotype (p = 0.059). No genome-wide statistically significant 
      interactions were observed for smoking. If replicated our suggestive finding of a
      genome-wide significant interaction between genetic variants and alcohol
      consumption might contribute to understanding colorectal cancer etiology and
      identifying subpopulations with differential susceptibility to the effect of
      alcohol on CRC risk.

LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.11041 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common pancreatic cancer
      susceptibility variants at 13 chromosomal loci in individuals of European
      descent. To identify new susceptibility variants, we performed imputation based
      on 1000 Genomes (1000G) Project data and association analysis using 5,107 case
      and 8,845 control subjects from 27 cohort and case-control studies that
      participated in the PanScan I-III GWAS. This analysis, in combination with a
      two-staged replication in an additional 6,076 case and 7,555 control subjects
      from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) and Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control
      (PanC4) Consortia uncovered 3 new pancreatic cancer risk signals marked by single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2816938 at chromosome 1q32.1 (per allele odds
      ratio (OR) = 1.20, P = 4.88x10 -15), rs10094872 at 8q24.21 (OR = 1.15, P =
      3.22x10 -9) and rs35226131 at 5p15.33 (OR = 0.71, P = 1.70x10 -8). These SNPs
      represent independent risk variants at previously identified pancreatic cancer
      risk loci on chr1q32.1 ( NR5A2), chr8q24.21 ( MYC) and chr5p15.33 ( CLPTM1L-
      TERT) as per analyses conditioned on previously reported susceptibility variants.
      We assessed expression of candidate genes at the three risk loci in
      histologically normal ( n = 10) and tumor ( n = 8) derived pancreatic tissue
      samples and observed a marked reduction of NR5A2 expression (chr1q32.1) in the
      tumors (fold change -7.6, P = 5.7x10 -8). This finding was validated in a second 
      set of paired ( n = 20) histologically normal and tumor derived pancreatic tissue
      samples (average fold change for three NR5A2 isoforms -31.3 to -95.7, P = 7.5x10 
      -4-2.0x10 -3). Our study has identified new susceptibility variants independently
      conferring pancreatic cancer risk that merit functional follow-up to identify
      target genes and explain the underlying biology.

AB  - Nearly 50% of cancer patients undergo radiotherapy. Late radiotherapy toxicity
      affects quality-of-life in long-term cancer survivors and risk of side-effects in
      a minority limits doses prescribed to the majority of patients. Development of a 
      test predicting risk of toxicity could benefit many cancer patients. We aimed to 
      meta-analyze individual level data from four genome-wide association studies from
      prostate cancer radiotherapy cohorts including 1564 men to identify genetic
      markers of toxicity. Prospectively assessed two-year toxicity endpoints (urinary 
      frequency, decreased urine stream, rectal bleeding, overall toxicity) and single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations were tested using multivariable
      regression, adjusting for clinical and patient-related risk factors. A
      fixed-effects meta-analysis identified two SNPs: rs17599026 on 5q31.2 with
      urinary frequency (odds ratio [OR] 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.08-4.69, 
      p-value 4.16x10(-8)) and rs7720298 on 5p15.2 with decreased urine stream (OR
      2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, p-value=3.21x10(-8)). These SNPs lie within genes that
      are expressed in tissues adversely affected by pelvic radiotherapy including
      bladder, kidney, rectum and small intestine. The results show that heterogeneous 
      radiotherapy cohorts can be combined to identify new moderate-penetrance genetic 
      variants associated with radiotherapy toxicity. The work provides a basis for
      larger collaborative efforts to identify enough variants for a future test
      involving polygenic risk profiling.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of lung cancer have identified
      regions of common genetic variation with lung cancer risk in Europeans who smoke 
      and never-smoking Asian women. This study aimed to conduct a GWAS in African
      Americans, who have higher rates of lung cancer despite smoking fewer cigarettes 
      per day when compared with Caucasians. This population provides a different
      genetic architecture based on underlying African ancestry allowing the
      identification of new regions and exploration of known regions for finer mapping.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We genotyped 1,024,001 SNPs in 1737 cases and 3602
      controls in stage 1, followed by a replication phase of 20 SNPs (p<1.51x10(-5))
      in an independent set of 866 cases and 796 controls in stage 2. RESULTS AND
      CONCLUSION: In the combined analysis, we confirmed two loci to be associated with
      lung cancer that achieved the threshold of genome-wide significance: 15q25.1
      marked by rs2036527 (p=1.3x10(-9); OR=1.32; 95% CI=1.20-1.44) near CHRNA5, and
      5p15.33 marked by rs2853677 (p=2.8x10(-9); OR=1.28; 95% CI=1.18-1.39) near TERT. 
      The association with rs2853677 is driven by the adenocarcinoma subtype of lung
      cancer (p=1.3x10(-8); OR=1.37; 95% CI=1.23-1.54). No SNPs reached genome-wide
      significance for either of the main effect models examining smoking - cigarettes 
      per day and current or former smoker. Our study was powered to identify strong
      risk loci for lung cancer in African Americans; we confirmed results previously
      reported in African Americans and other populations for two loci near plausible
      candidate genes, CHRNA5 and TERT, on 15q25.1 and 5p15.33 respectively, are
      associated with lung cancer. Additional work is required to map and understand
      the biological underpinnings of the strong association of these loci with lung
      cancer risk in African Americans.

TI  - Genome-wide association study in East Asians identifies two novel breast cancer
      susceptibility loci.

AB  - Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide.
      Genetic factors have been shown to play an important role in breast cancer
      aetiology. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS)
      including 14 224 cases and 14 829 controls of East Asian women to search for
      novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. Single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in two loci were found to be associated with breast cancer
      risk at the genome-wide significance level. The first locus, represented by
      rs12118297 at 1p22.3 (near the LMO4 gene), was associated with breast cancer risk
      with odds ratio (OR) and (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 0.91 (0.88-0.94) and a
      P-value of 4.48 x 10(-) (8) This association was replicated in another study,
      DRIVE GAME-ON Consortium, including 16 003 cases and 41 335 controls of European 
      ancestry (OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91-0.99, P-value = 0.019). The second locus,
      rs16992204 at 21q22.12 (near the LINC00160 gene), was associated with breast
      cancer risk with OR (95% CI) of 1.13 (1.07-1.18) and a P-value of 4.63 x 10 (-)
      (8) The risk allele frequency for this SNP is zero in European-ancestry
      populations in 1000 Genomes Project and thus its association with breast cancer
      risk cannot be assessed in DRIVE GAME-ON Consortium. Functional annotation using 
      the ENCODE data indicates that rs12118297 might be located in a repressed element
      and locus 21q22.12 may affect breast cancer risk through regulating LINC00160
      expressions and interaction with oestrogen receptor signalling. Our findings
      provide additional insights into the genetics of breast cancer.

PG  - 42216-42224
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.9916 [doi]
AB  - Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in subjects of European descent
      have identified associations between cervical cancer risk and three independent
      loci as well as multiple classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles at
      6p21.3. To search for novel loci associated with development of cervical cancer, 
      we performed a pooled analysis of data from two GWASs by imputing over 10 million
      genetic variants and 424 classical HLA alleles, for 1,553 intraepithelial
      neoplasia 3 (CIN3), 81 cervical cancer and 4,442 controls from the Swedish
      population. Notable findings were validated in an independent study of 961
      patients (827 with CIN3 and 123 with cervical cancer) and 1,725 controls. Our
      data provided increased support for previously identified loci at 6p21.3
      (rs9271898, P = 1.2 x 10-24; rs2516448, 1.1 x 10-15; and rs3130196, 2.3 x 10-9,
      respectively) and also confirmed associations with reported classical HLA alleles
      including HLA-B*07:02, -B*15:01, -DRB1*13:01, -DRB1*15:01, -DQA1*01:03,
      -DQB1*06:03 and -DQB1*06:02. In addition, we identified and subsequently
      replicated an independent signal at rs73730372 at 6p21.3 (odds ratio = 0.60, 95% 
      confidence interval = 0.54-0.67, P = 3.0 x 10-19), which was found to be an
      expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) of both HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1. This is
      one of the strongest common genetic protective variants identified so far for
      CIN3. We also found HLA-C*07:02 to be associated with risk of CIN3. The present
      study provides new insights into pathogenesis of CIN3.

      on cases unselected for family history and have reported over 100 significant
      associations. The International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG)
      has now performed a GWAS of 2511 (unrelated) familial prostate cancer cases and
      1382 unaffected controls from 12 member sites. All samples were genotyped on the 
      Illumina 5M+exome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) platform. The GWAS
      identified a significant evidence for association for SNPs in six regions
      previously associated with prostate cancer in population-based cohorts, including
      3q26.2, 6q25.3, 8q24.21, 10q11.23, 11q13.3, and 17q12. Of note, SNP rs138042437
      (p = 1.7e(-8)) at 8q24.21 achieved a large estimated effect size in this cohort
      (odds ratio = 13.3). 116 previously sampled affected relatives of 62 risk-allele 
      carriers from the GWAS cohort were genotyped for this SNP, identifying 78
      additional affected carriers in 62 pedigrees. A test for an excess number of
      affected carriers among relatives exhibited strong evidence for co-segregation of
      the variant with disease (p = 8.5e(-11)). The majority (92 %) of risk-allele
      carriers at rs138042437 had a consistent estimated haplotype spanning
      approximately 100 kb of 8q24.21 that contained the minor alleles of three rare
      SNPs (dosage minor allele frequencies <1.7 %), rs183373024 (PRNCR1), previously
      associated SNP rs188140481, and rs138042437 (CASC19). Strong evidence for
      co-segregation of a SNP on the haplotype further characterizes the haplotype as a
      prostate cancer predisposition locus.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of colorectal cancer in Hispanics.
PG  - 547-556

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 58 susceptibility alleles 
      across 37 regions associated with the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) with P <
      5x10(-8) Most studies have been conducted in non-Hispanic whites and East Asians;
      however, the generalizability of these findings and the potential for
      ethnic-specific risk variation in Hispanic and Latino (HL) individuals have been 
      largely understudied. We describe the first GWAS of common genetic variation
      contributing to CRC risk in HL (1611 CRC cases and 4330 controls). We also
      examine known susceptibility alleles and implement imputation-based fine-mapping 
      to identify potential ethnicity-specific association signals in known risk
      regions. We discovered 17 variants across 4 independent regions that merit
      further investigation due to suggestive CRC associations (P < 1x10(-6)) at 1p34.3
      (rs7528276; Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.86 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.47-2.36); P =
      2.5x10(-7)], 2q23.3 (rs1367374; OR = 1.37 (95% CI: 1.21-1.55); P = 4.0x10(-7)),
      14q24.2 (rs143046984; OR = 1.65 (95% CI: 1.36-2.01); P = 4.1x10(-7)) and 16q12.2 
      [rs142319636; OR = 1.69 (95% CI: 1.37-2.08); P=7.8x10(-7)]. Among the 57
      previously published CRC susceptibility alleles with minor allele frequency
      >/=1%, 76.5% of SNPs had a consistent direction of effect and 19 (33.3%) were
      nominally statistically significant (P < 0.05). Further, rs185423955 and
      rs60892987 were identified as novel secondary susceptibility variants at 3q26.2
      (P = 5.3x10(-5)) and 11q12.2 (P = 6.8x10(-5)), respectively. Our findings
      demonstrate the importance of fine mapping in HL. These results are informative
      for variant prioritization in functional studies and future risk prediction
      modeling in minority populations.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Study of Bladder Cancer in a Chinese Cohort Reveals a New

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of bladder cancer have identified a number
      of susceptibility loci in European populations but have yet to uncover the
      genetic determinants underlying bladder cancer incidence among other ethnicities.
      Therefore, we performed the first GWAS in a Chinese cohort comprising 3,406 cases
      of bladder cancer and 4,645 controls. We identified a new susceptibility locus
      for bladder cancer at 5q12.3, located in the intron of CWC27 (rs2042329), that
      was significantly associated with disease risk (OR = 1.40; P = 4.61 x 10(-11)).
      However, rs2042329 was not associated with bladder cancer risk in patients of
      European descent. The rs2042329 risk allele was also related to significantly
      increased expression levels of CWC27 mRNA and protein in bladder cancer tissues
      from Chinese patients. Additional functional analyses suggested that CWC27 played
      an oncogenic role in bladder cancer by inducing cell proliferation and
      suppressing apoptosis. In conclusion, the identification of a risk-associated
      locus at 5q12.3 provides new insights into the inherited susceptibility to
      bladder cancer in Chinese populations and may help to identify high-risk
      individuals. Cancer Res; 76(11); 3277-84. (c)2016 AACR.

TI  - Cross-Cancer Genome-Wide Analysis of Lung, Ovary, Breast, Prostate, and
      Colorectal Cancer Reveals Novel Pleiotropic Associations.
PG  - 5103-14
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-2980 [doi]
AB  - Identifying genetic variants with pleiotropic associations can uncover common
      pathways influencing multiple cancers. We took a two-stage approach to conduct
      genome-wide association studies for lung, ovary, breast, prostate, and colorectal
      cancer from the GAME-ON/GECCO Network (61,851 cases, 61,820 controls) to identify
      pleiotropic loci. Findings were replicated in independent association studies
      (55,789 cases, 330,490 controls). We identified a novel pleiotropic association
      at 1q22 involving breast and lung squamous cell carcinoma, with eQTL analysis
      showing an association with ADAM15/THBS3 gene expression in lung. We also
      identified a known breast cancer locus CASP8/ALS2CR12 associated with prostate
      cancer, a known cancer locus at CDKN2B-AS1 with different variants associated
      with lung adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer, and confirmed the associations of a
      breast BRCA2 locus with lung and serous ovarian cancer. This is the largest study
      to date examining pleiotropy across multiple cancer-associated loci, identifying 
      common mechanisms of cancer development and progression. Cancer Res; 76(17);

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx are referred to as 
      head and neck cancers (HNC); together they account for 2-3% of all newly
      diagnosed cancers in North America. Between 40-50% of HNC are early diagnosed at 
      stages I-II. The 5-year and 10-year relative survival rates are 61% and 50%,
      respectively. Germline genetic sequence variants (GSV) have become increasingly
      found to have prognostic implications in a variety of cancers. Identifying these 
      variants may have important clinical and biological implications. METHODS: We
      conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 531 Stage I-II
      radiation-treated HNC patients (originally recruited for
      alpha-tocopherol/beta-carotene placebo-controlled secondary prevention study) and
      used a replication cohort of 566 HNC patients of all stages, of mostly
      non-HPV-related cancers. Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
      method. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for potential clinical factors
      and principal components were used to test for associations between the GSV and
      overall survival (OS) in these tumors. RESULTS: The median follow-up time for OS 
      was 9.21 years (GWAS cohort) and 2.37 years (replication cohort). In both
      cohorts, CACNA2D1:rs2299187, ESRRG:rs946465 and ESRRG:rs1416612 were each
      individually significantly associated with survival. In silico analysis of
      ESRRG:rs946465 identifies that it produces a splice variant in ESRRG. Variant
      alleles of CACNA2D1:rs2299187 and ESRRG:rs946465 were associated with higher
      expression of the corresponding protein. CONCLUSIONS: Putatively functional
      polymorphisms in the MAP-Kinase and estrogen pathways, identified through GWAS
      and replicated in an independent dataset were associated with the survival of HNC
      patients.

TI  - Common genetic variation in ETV6 is associated with colorectal cancer
      susceptibility.
PG  - 11478
LID - 10.1038/ncomms11478 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple susceptibility
      loci for colorectal cancer, but much of heritability remains unexplained. To
      identify additional susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer, here we perform a 
      GWAS in 1,023 cases and 1,306 controls and replicate the findings in seven
      independent samples from China, comprising 5,317 cases and 6,887 controls. We
      find a variant at 12p13.2 associated with colorectal cancer risk (rs2238126 in
      ETV6, P=2.67 x 10(-10)). We replicate this association in an additional 1,046
      cases and 1,076 controls of European ancestry (P=0.034). The G allele of
      rs2238126 confers earlier age at onset of colorectal cancer (P=1.98 x 10(-6)) and
      reduces the binding affinity of transcriptional enhancer MAX. The mRNA level of
      ETV6 is significantly lower in colorectal tumours than in paired normal tissues. 
      Our findings highlight the potential importance of genetic variation in ETV6
      conferring susceptibility to colorectal cancer.

PG  - 4890-4900
AB  - PURPOSE: Discovery of SNPs that predict a patient's risk of docetaxel-induced
      neuropathy would enable treatment individualization to maximize efficacy and
      avoid unnecessary toxicity. The objectives of this analysis were to discover SNPs
      associated with docetaxel-induced neuropathy and mechanistically validate these
      associations in preclinical models of drug-induced neuropathy. EXPERIMENTAL
      DESIGN: A genome-wide association study was conducted in metastatic
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with docetaxel, prednisone
      and randomized to bevacizumab or placebo on CALGB 90401. SNPs were genotyped on
      the Illumina HumanHap610-Quad platform followed by rigorous quality control. The 
      inference was conducted on the cumulative dose at occurrence of grade 3+ sensory 
      neuropathy using a cause-specific hazard model that accounted for early treatment
      discontinuation. Genes with SNPs significantly associated with neuropathy were
      knocked down in cellular and mouse models of drug-induced neuropathy. RESULTS: A 
      total of 498,081 SNPs were analyzed in 623 Caucasian patients, 50 (8%) of whom
      experienced grade 3+ neuropathy. The 1,000 SNPs most associated with neuropathy
      clustered in relevant pathways including neuropathic pain and axonal guidance. An
      SNP in VAC14 (rs875858) surpassed genome-wide significance (P = 2.12 x 10(-8),
      adjusted P = 5.88 x 10(-7)). siRNA knockdown of VAC14 in stem cell-derived
      peripheral neuronal cells increased docetaxel sensitivity as measured by
      decreased neurite processes (P = 0.0015) and branches (P < 0.0001). Prior to
      docetaxel treatment, VAC14 heterozygous mice had greater nociceptive sensitivity 
      than wild-type litter mate controls (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: VAC14 should be
      prioritized for further validation of its potential role as a predictor of
      docetaxel-induced neuropathy and biomarker for treatment individualization. Clin 
      Cancer Res; 22(19); 4890-900. (c)2016 AACR.

AB  - We conducted a meta-analysis of three endometrial cancer genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS) and two follow-up phases totaling 7,737 endometrial cancer cases
      and 37,144 controls of European ancestry. Genome-wide imputation and
      meta-analysis identified five new risk loci of genome-wide significance at likely
      regulatory regions on chromosomes 13q22.1 (rs11841589, near KLF5), 6q22.31
      (rs13328298, in LOC643623 and near HEY2 and NCOA7), 8q24.21 (rs4733613, telomeric
      to MYC), 15q15.1 (rs937213, in EIF2AK4, near BMF) and 14q32.33 (rs2498796, in
      AKT1, near SIVA1). We also found a second independent 8q24.21 signal
      (rs17232730). Functional studies of the 13q22.1 locus showed that rs9600103
      (pairwise r(2) = 0.98 with rs11841589) is located in a region of active chromatin
      that interacts with the KLF5 promoter region. The rs9600103[T] allele that is
      protective in endometrial cancer suppressed gene expression in vitro, suggesting 
      that regulation of the expression of KLF5, a gene linked to uterine development, 
      is implicated in tumorigenesis. These findings provide enhanced insight into the 
      genetic and biological basis of endometrial cancer.

TI  - Identification of four novel susceptibility loci for oestrogen receptor negative 
      breast cancer.
PG  - 11375
LID - 10.1038/ncomms11375 [doi]
AB  - Common variants in 94 loci have been associated with breast cancer including 15
      loci with genome-wide significant associations (P<5 x 10(-8)) with oestrogen
      receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer and BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk. In 
      this study, to identify new ER-negative susceptibility loci, we performed a
      meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisting of 4,939
      ER-negative cases and 14,352 controls, combined with 7,333 ER-negative cases and 
      42,468 controls and 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers genotyped on the iCOGS array. 
      We identify four previously unidentified loci including two loci at 13q22 near
      KLF5, a 2p23.2 locus near WDR43 and a 2q33 locus near PPIL3 that display
      genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer. In addition,
      19 known breast cancer risk loci have genome-wide significant associations and 40
      had moderate associations (P<0.05) with ER-negative disease. Using functional and
      eQTL studies we implicate TRMT61B and WDR43 at 2p23.2 and PPIL3 at 2q33 in
      ER-negative breast cancer aetiology. All ER-negative loci combined account for
      approximately 11% of familial relative risk for ER-negative disease and may
      contribute to improved ER-negative and BRCA1 breast cancer risk prediction.

TI  - Genome-Wide Study of Response to Platinum, Taxane, and Combination Therapy in
      Ovarian Cancer: In vitro Phenotypes, Inherited Variation, and Disease Recurrence.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2016.00037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients
      with advanced disease is carboplatin-paclitaxel combination therapy following
      initial debulking surgery, yet there is wide inter-patient variation in clinical 
      response. We sought to identify pharmacogenomic markers related to
      carboplatin-paclitaxel therapy. METHODS: The lymphoblastoid cell lines, derived
      from 74 invasive EOC patients seen at the Mayo Clinic, were treated with
      increasing concentrations of carboplatin and/or paclitaxel and assessed for in
      vitro drug response using MTT viability and caspase3/7 apoptosis assays. Drug
      response phenotypes IC50 (effective dose at which 50% of cells are viable) and
      EC50 (dose resulting in 50% induction of caspase 3/7 activity) were estimated for
      each patient to paclitaxel and carboplatin (alone and in combination). For each
      of the six drug response phenotypes, a genome-wide association study was
      conducted. RESULTS: Statistical analysis found paclitaxel in vitro drug response 
      phenotypes to be moderately associated with time to EOC recurrence (p = 0.008
      IC50; p = 0.058 EC50). Although no pharmacogenomic associations were significant 
      at p < 5 x 10(-8), seven genomic loci were associated with drug response at p <
      10(-6), including at 4q21.21 for carboplatin, 4p16.1 and 5q23.2 for paclitaxel,
      and 3q24, 10q, 1q44, and 13q21 for combination therapy. Nearby genes of interest 
      include FRAS1, MGC32805, SNCAIP, SLC9A9, TIAL1, ZNF731P, and PCDH20. CONCLUSIONS:
      These results suggest the existence of genetic loci associated with response to
      platinum-taxane therapies. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism
      by which these loci may impact EOC clinical response to this commonly used
      regimen.

TI  - GWAS meta-analysis of 16 852 women identifies new susceptibility locus for
      endometrial cancer.
PG  - 2612-2620
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in the developed
      world. Although there is evidence of genetic predisposition to the disease, most 
      of the genetic risk remains unexplained. We present the meta-analysis results of 
      four genome-wide association studies (4907 cases and 11 945 controls total) in
      women of European ancestry. We describe one new locus reaching genome-wide
      significance (P < 5 x 10 (-)(8)) at 6p22.3 (rs1740828; P = 2.29 x 10 (-)(8), OR =
      1.20), providing evidence of an additional region of interest for genetic
      susceptibility to endometrial cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Known genetic factors explain only a small fraction of genetic
      variation in colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a genome-wide association
      study to identify risk loci for CRC. METHODS: This discovery stage included 8027 
      cases and 22,577 controls of East-Asian ancestry. Promising variants were
      evaluated in studies including as many as 11,044 cases and 12,047 controls.
      Tumor-adjacent normal tissues from 188 patients were analyzed to evaluate
      correlations of risk variants with expression levels of nearby genes. Potential
      functionality of risk variants were evaluated using public genomic and epigenomic
      databases. RESULTS: We identified 4 loci associated with CRC risk; P values for
      the most significant variant in each locus ranged from 3.92 x 10(-8) to 1.24 x
      10(-12): 6p21.1 (rs4711689), 8q23.3 (rs2450115, rs6469656), 10q24.3 (rs4919687), 
      and 12p13.3 (rs11064437). We also identified 2 risk variants at loci previously
      associated with CRC: 10q25.2 (rs10506868) and 20q13.3 (rs6061231). These risk
      variants, conferring an approximate 10%-18% increase in risk per allele, are
      located either inside or near protein-coding genes that include transcription
      factor EB (lysosome biogenesis and autophagy), eukaryotic translation initiation 
      factor 3, subunit H (initiation of translation), cytochrome P450, family 17,
      subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (steroidogenesis), splA/ryanodine receptor domain and 
      SOCS box containing 2 (proteasome degradation), and ribosomal protein S2
      (ribosome biogenesis). Gene expression analyses showed a significant association 
      (P < .05) for rs4711689 with transcription factor EB, rs6469656 with eukaryotic
      translation initiation factor 3, subunit H, rs11064437 with splA/ryanodine
      receptor domain and SOCS box containing 2, and rs6061231 with ribosomal protein
      S2. CONCLUSIONS: We identified susceptibility loci and genes associated with CRC 
      risk, linking CRC predisposition to steroid hormone, protein synthesis and
      degradation, and autophagy pathways and providing added insight into the
      mechanism of CRC pathogenesis.

TI  - CYP24A1 variant modifies the association between use of oestrogen plus
      progestogen therapy and colorectal cancer risk.
PG  - 221-9
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2015.443 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use has been consistently associated
      with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in women. Our aim was to use a
      genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis to identify genetic modifiers
      of CRC risk associated with use of MHT. METHODS: We included 10 835
      postmenopausal women (5419 cases and 5416 controls) from 10 studies. We evaluated
      use of any MHT, oestrogen-only (E-only) and combined oestrogen-progestogen (E+P) 
      hormone preparations. To test for multiplicative interactions, we applied the
      empirical Bayes (EB) test as well as the Wald test in conventional case-control
      logistic regression as primary tests. The Cocktail test was used as secondary
      test. RESULTS: The EB test identified a significant interaction between rs964293 
      at 20q13.2/CYP24A1 and E+P (interaction OR (95% CIs)=0.61 (0.52-0.72), P=4.8 x
      10(-9)). The secondary analysis also identified this interaction (Cocktail test
      OR=0.64 (0.52-0.78), P=1.2 x 10(-5) (alpha threshold=3.1 x 10(-4)). The ORs for
      association between E+P and CRC risk by rs964293 genotype were as follows: C/C,
      0.96 (0.61-1.50); A/C, 0.61 (0.39-0.95) and A/A, 0.40 (0.22-0.73), respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that rs964293 modifies the association between 
      E+P and CRC risk. The variant is located near CYP24A1, which encodes an enzyme
      involved in vitamin D metabolism. This novel finding offers additional insight
      into downstream pathways of CRC etiopathogenesis.

TI  - Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies multiple lung cancer 
      susceptibility loci in never-smoking Asian women.
PG  - 620-9
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddv494 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of lung cancer in Asian never-smoking
      women have previously identified six susceptibility loci associated with lung
      cancer risk. To further discover new susceptibility loci, we imputed data from
      four GWAS of Asian non-smoking female lung cancer (6877 cases and 6277 controls) 
      using the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 1 Release 3) data as the reference and
      genotyped additional samples (5878 cases and 7046 controls) for possible
      replication. In our meta-analysis, three new loci achieved genome-wide
      significance, marked by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs7741164 at 6p21.1 
      (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.17; P = 5.8 x 10(-13)), rs72658409 at 9p21.3
      (per-allele OR = 0.77; P = 1.41 x 10(-10)) and rs11610143 at 12q13.13 (per-allele
      OR = 0.89; P = 4.96 x 10(-9)). These findings identified new genetic
      susceptibility alleles for lung cancer in never-smoking women in Asia and merit
      follow-up to understand their biological underpinnings.

TI  - Identification of new susceptibility loci for gastric non-cardia adenocarcinoma:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of non-cardia 
      gastric cancer have been published, more novel association signals could be
      exploited by combining individual studies together, which will further elucidate 
      the genetic susceptibility of non-cardia gastric cancer. DESIGN: We conducted a
      meta-analysis of two published Chinese GWAS studies (2031 non-cardia gastric
      cancer cases and 4970 cancer-free controls) and followed by genotyping of
      additional 3564 cases and 4637 controls in two stages. RESULTS: The overall
      meta-analysis revealed two new association signals. The first was a novel locus
      at 5q14.3 and marked by rs7712641 (per-allele OR=0.84, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.88;
      p=1.21x10(-11)). This single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker maps to the
      intron of the long non-coding RNA, lnc-POLR3G-4 (XLOC_004464), which we observed 
      has lower expression in non-cardia gastric tumour compared with matched normal
      tissue (Pwilcoxon signed-rank=7.20x10(-4)). We also identified a new signal at
      the 1q22 locus, rs80142782 (per-allele OR=0.62; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.69;
      p=1.71x10(-19)), which was independent of the previously reported SNP at the same
      locus, rs4072037 (per-allele OR=0.74; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.79; p=6.28x10(-17)).
      Analysis of the new SNP conditioned on the known SNP showed that the new SNP
      remained genome-wide significant (Pconditional=3.47x10(-8)). Interestingly,
      rs80142782 has a minor allele frequency of 0.05 in East Asians but is monomorphic
      in both European and African populations. CONCLUSION: These findings add new
      evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to non-cardia gastric cancer and
      provide further clues to its aetiology in the Han Chinese population.

TI  - Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies common susceptibility
      polymorphisms for colorectal and endometrial cancer near SH2B3 and TSHZ1.
PG  - 17369
LID - 10.1038/srep17369 [doi]
AB  - High-risk mutations in several genes predispose to both colorectal cancer (CRC)
      and endometrial cancer (EC). We therefore hypothesised that some lower-risk
      genetic variants might also predispose to both CRC and EC. Using CRC and EC
      genome-wide association series, totalling 13,265 cancer cases and 40,245
      controls, we found that the protective allele [G] at one previously-identified
      CRC polymorphism, rs2736100 near TERT, was associated with EC risk (odds ratio
      (OR) = 1.08, P = 0.000167); this polymorphism influences the risk of several
      other cancers. A further CRC polymorphism near TERC also showed evidence of
      association with EC (OR = 0.92; P = 0.03). Overall, however, there was no good
      evidence that the set of CRC polymorphisms was associated with EC risk, and
      neither of two previously-reported EC polymorphisms was associated with CRC risk.
      A combined analysis revealed one genome-wide significant polymorphism, rs3184504,
      on chromosome 12q24 (OR = 1.10, P = 7.23 x 10(-9)) with shared effects on CRC and
      EC risk. This polymorphism, a missense variant in the gene SH2B3, is also
      associated with haematological and autoimmune disorders, suggesting that it
      influences cancer risk through the immune response. Another polymorphism,
      rs12970291 near gene TSHZ1, was associated with both CRC and EC (OR = 1.26, P =
      4.82 x 10(-8)), with the alleles showing opposite effects on the risks of the two
      cancers.

TI  - Common genetic variation and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis: a
      genome-wide analysis.
PG  - 87-95
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgv161 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies have identified several germline single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with colorectal cancer
      (CRC) incidence. Common germline genetic variation may also be related to CRC
      survival. We used a discovery-based approach to identify SNPs related to survival
      outcomes after CRC diagnosis. Genome-wide genotyping arrays were conducted for
      3494 individuals with invasive CRC enrolled in six prospective cohort studies
      (median study-specific follow-up = 4.2-8.1 years). In pooled analyses, we used
      Cox regression to assess SNP-specific associations with CRC-specific and overall 
      survival, with additional analyses stratified by stage at diagnosis. Top findings
      were followed-up in independent studies. A P value threshold of P < 5x10(-8) in
      analyses combining discovery and follow-up studies was required for genome-wide
      significance. Among individuals with distant-metastatic CRC, several SNPs at
      6p12.1, nearest the ELOVL5 gene, were statistically significantly associated with
      poorer survival, with the strongest associations noted for rs209489 [hazard ratio
      (HR) = 1.8, P = 7.6x10(-10) and HR = 1.8, P = 3.7x10(-9) for CRC-specific and
      overall survival, respectively). No SNPs were statistically significantly
      associated with survival among all cases combined or in cases without
      distant-metastases. SNPs in 6p12.1/ELOVL5 were associated with survival outcomes 
      in individuals with distant-metastatic CRC, and merit further follow-up for
      functional significance. Findings from this genome-wide association study
      highlight the potential importance of genetic variation in CRC prognosis and
      provide clues to genomic regions of potential interest.

      Patients with Cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: Pazopanib is an effective treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma
      and soft-tissue sarcoma. Transaminase elevations have been commonly observed in
      pazopanib-treated patients. We conducted pharmacogenetic analyses to explore
      mechanistic insight into pazopanib-induced liver injury. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The
      discovery analysis tested association between four-digit HLA alleles and alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT) elevation in pazopanib-treated patients with cancer from
      eight clinical trials (N = 1,188). We conducted confirmatory analysis using an
      independent dataset of pazopanib-treated patients from 23 additional trials (N = 
      1,002). Genome-wide association study (GWAS) for transaminase elevations was also
      conducted. RESULTS: The discovery study identified an association between
      HLA-B*57:01 carriage and ALT elevation [P = 5.0 x 10(-5) for maximum on-treatment
      ALT (MaxALT); P = 4.8 x 10(-4) for time to ALT > 3x upper limit of normal (ULN)
      event; P = 4.1 x 10(-5) for time to ALT > 5x ULN event] that is significant after
      adjustment for number of HLA alleles tested. We confirmed these associations with
      time to ALT elevation event (P = 8.1 x 10(-4) for ALT > 3x ULN, P = 9.8 x 10(-3) 
      for ALT > 5x ULN) in an independent dataset. In the combined data, HLA-B*57:01
      carriage was associated with ALT elevation (P = 4.3 x 10(-5) for MaxALT, P = 5.1 
      x 10(-6) for time to ALT > 3xULN event, P = 5.8 x 10(-6) for time to ALT > 5x ULN
      event). In HLA-B*57:01 carriers and noncarriers, frequency of ALT > 3x ULN was
      31% and 19%, respectively, and frequency of ALT > 5x ULN was 18% and 10%,
      respectively. GWAS revealed a possible borderline association, which requires
      further evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that HLA-B*57:01 carriage
      confers higher risk of ALT elevation in patients receiving pazopanib and provide 
      novel insight implicating an immune-mediated mechanism for pazopanib-associated
      hepatotoxicity in some patients.

TI  - Large-scale association analysis in Asians identifies new susceptibility loci for
      prostate cancer.
PG  - 8469
LID - 10.1038/ncomms9469 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 100 genetic 
      loci associated with prostate cancer risk. Less than a dozen of these loci were
      initially identified from GWAS in two Asian populations, likely because of
      smaller sample sizes of these individual GWAS in Asians. Here, we conduct a
      large-scale meta-analysis of two GWAS from the Japanese population (1,583 cases
      and 3,386 controls) and the Chinese population (1,417 cases and 1,008 controls), 
      followed by replication in three independent sample sets. We identify two
      independent susceptibility loci for prostate cancer at 11p15.4 (rs12791447,
      P=3.59 x 10(-8); PPFIBP2) and 14q23.2 (rs58262369, P=6.05 x 10(-10); ESR2). The
      mRNA levels of PPFIBP2 and ESR2 are differentially expressed in prostate tumours 
      and paired normal tissues. Our study adds two new loci to the limited number of
      prostate cancer risk-associated variants in Asians and provides important insight
      into potential biological mechanisms of prostate cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unnecessary intervention and overtreatment of indolent disease are
      common challenges in clinical management of prostate cancer. Improved tools to
      distinguish lethal from indolent disease are critical. METHODS: We performed a
      genome-wide survival analysis of cause-specific death in 24,023 prostate cancer
      patients (3,513 disease-specific deaths) from the PRACTICAL and BPC3 consortia.
      Top findings were assessed for replication in a Norwegian cohort (CONOR).
      RESULTS: We observed no significant association between genetic variants and
      prostate cancer survival. CONCLUSIONS: Common genetic variants with large impact 
      on prostate cancer survival were not observed in this study. IMPACT: Future
      studies should be designed for identification of rare variants with large effect 
      sizes or common variants with small effect sizes.

LID - 10.1038/ng.3374 [doi]
AB  - Anthracyclines are used in over 50% of childhood cancer treatment protocols, but 
      their clinical usefulness is limited by anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity
      (ACT) manifesting as asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction and congestive heart
      failure in up to 57% and 16% of patients, respectively. Candidate gene studies
      have reported genetic associations with ACT, but these studies have in general
      lacked robust patient numbers, independent replication or functional validation. 
      Thus, the individual variability in ACT susceptibility remains largely
      unexplained. We performed a genome-wide association study in 280 patients of
      European ancestry treated for childhood cancer, with independent replication in
      similarly treated cohorts of 96 European and 80 non-European patients. We
      identified a nonsynonymous variant (rs2229774, p.Ser427Leu) in RARG highly
      associated with ACT (P = 5.9 x 10(-8), odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 4.7
      (2.7-8.3)). This variant alters RARG function, leading to derepression of the key
      ACT genetic determinant Top2b, and provides new insight into the pathophysiology 
      of this severe adverse drug reaction.

      Therapy of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: Despite expanding options for systemic treatment, survival for
      metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains limited and individual response is
      difficult to predict. In search of pre-treatment predictors, pharmacogenetic
      research has mainly used a candidate gene approach. Genome wide association (GWA)
      studies offer the benefit of simultaneously analyzing a large number of SNPs, in 
      both known and still unidentified functional regions. Using a GWA approach, we
      searched for genetic markers affecting progression free survival (PFS) in mCRC
      patients treated with first-line capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab
      (CAPOX-B), with or without cetuximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 755 patients were
      included in the CAIRO2-trial, a multicenter phase III trial, randomizing between 
      first-line treatment with CAPOX-B versus CAPOX-B plus cetuximab. Germline DNA and
      complete clinical information was available from 553 patients and genome wide
      genotyping was performed, using Illumina's OmniExpress beadchip arrays, with
      647,550 markers passing all quality checks. Another 2,202,473 markers were
      imputated by using HapMap2. Association with PFS was analysed using a Cox
      proportional hazards model. RESULTS: One marker, rs885036, associated
      significantly with PFS (P = 2.17x10(-8)) showing opposite effects on PFS
      depending on treatment arm. The minor allele was associated with increased PFS in
      patients receiving cetuximab. A cluster of markers located on chromosome 8
      associated with PFS, irrespective of treatment arm (P-values of 2.30x10(-7) to
      1.04x10(-6)). CONCLUSION: This is the first GWA study to find SNPs affecting PFS 
      in mCRC patients treated with CAPOX-B, either with or without cetuximab. Rs885036
      is a potential predictive marker for cetuximab efficacy. These markers need to be
      validated in independent treatment cohorts.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of colorectal cancer identifies six new
      susceptibility loci.
PG  - 7138
LID - 10.1038/ncomms8138 [doi]
AB  - Genetic susceptibility to colorectal cancer is caused by rare pathogenic
      mutations and common genetic variants that contribute to familial risk. Here we
      report the results of a two-stage association study with 18,299 cases of
      colorectal cancer and 19,656 controls, with follow-up of the most statistically
      significant genetic loci in 4,725 cases and 9,969 controls from two Asian
      consortia. We describe six new susceptibility loci reaching a genome-wide
      threshold of P<5.0E-08. These findings provide additional insight into the
      underlying biological mechanisms of colorectal cancer and demonstrate the
      scientific value of large consortia-based genetic epidemiology studies.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of gastric adenocarcinoma in Asia: a comparison of 
      associations between cardia and non-cardia tumours.
PG  - 1611-8
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2015-309340 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of gastric cancer have reported
      differences in single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations for tumour
      subtypes, particularly when divided by location into the gastric cardia versus
      the non-cardia. DESIGN: Here we present results for a GWAS using 2350 East Asian 
      gastric cancer cases divided as 1189 gastric cardia and 1027 gastric non-cardia
      cases and 2708 controls. We also included up to 3042 cardia cases, 4359
      non-cardia cases and 7548 controls for replication from two Chinese studies and
      one Korean study. From the GWAS, we selected 12 top SNPs for each gastric cancer 
      subtype, 4 top SNPs for total gastric cancer and 1 SNP in MUC1 for replication
      testing. RESULTS: We observed genome-wide significant associations for rs10074991
      in PRKAA1 at 5p13.1 for cardia (p=7.36x10(-12)) and non-cardia cancers
      (p=2.42x10(-23)) with per allele OR (95% CI) for the combined endpoint of 0.80
      (0.77 to 0.83). At 6p21.1, rs2294693 near UNC5CL was significantly associated
      with gastric non-cardia cancer risk (p=2.50x10(-8)), with OR (95% CI) of 1.18
      (1.12 to 1.26), but there was only a nominal association for cardia cancer
      (p=1.47x10(-2)). We also confirmed a previously reported association for
      rs4072037 in MUC1 with p=6.59x10(-8) for total gastric cancer and similar
      estimates for cardia and non-cardia cancers. Three SNPs in PSCA previously
      reported to be associated with gastric non-cardia cancer showed no apparent
      association for cardia cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that associations
      for SNPs with gastric cancer show some different results by tumour location in
      the stomach.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the developed
      world. Both inherited high-penetrance mutations in BRCA2 (ref. 2), ATM, PALB2
      (ref. 4), BRCA1 (ref. 5), STK11 (ref. 6), CDKN2A and mismatch-repair genes and
      low-penetrance loci are associated with increased risk. To identify new risk
      loci, we performed a genome-wide association study on 9,925 pancreatic cancer
      cases and 11,569 controls, including 4,164 newly genotyped cases and 3,792
      controls in 9 studies from North America, Central Europe and Australia. We
      identified three newly associated regions: 17q25.1 (LINC00673, rs11655237, odds
      ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.34, P = 1.42 x 10(-14)),

      1.09-1.19, P = 3.36 x 10(-9)), a region with previous suggestive evidence in Han 
      Chinese. We replicated previously reported associations at 9q34.2 (ABO), 13q22.1 
      (KLF5), 5p15.33 (TERT and CLPTM1), 13q12.2 (PDX1), 1q32.1 (NR5A2), 7q32.3
      (LINC-PINT), 16q23.1 (BCAR1) and 22q12.1 (ZNRF3). Our study identifies new loci
      associated with pancreatic cancer risk.

TI  - Loss-of-function variants in ATM confer risk of gastric cancer.
PG  - 906-10
LID - 10.1038/ng.3342 [doi]
AB  - Gastric cancer is a serious health problem worldwide, with particularly high
      prevalence in eastern Asia. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Asian
      populations have identified several loci that associate with gastric cancer risk.
      Here we report a GWAS of gastric cancer in a European population, using
      information on 2,500 population-based gastric cancer cases and 205,652 controls. 
      We found a new gastric cancer association with loss-of-function mutations in ATM 
      (gene test, P = 8.0 x 10(-12); odds ratio (OR) = 4.74). The combination of the
      loss-of-function variants p.Gln852*, p.Ser644* and p.Tyr103* (combined minor
      allele frequency (MAF) = 0.3%) also associates with pancreatic and prostate
      cancers (OR = 3.81 and 2.18, respectively) and gives an indication of risk of
      breast and colorectal cancers (OR = 1.82 and 1.97, respectively). Cancers in
      those carrying loss-of-function ATM mutations are diagnosed at a significantly
      earlier age than in non-carriers. Our results confirm an association between
      gastric cancer in Europeans and three loci previously reported in Asians, MUC1,
      PRKAA1 and PSCA, refine the association signal at PRKAA1 and support a pathogenic
      role for the tandem repeat identified in MUC1.

AB  - UNLABELLED: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer in Kaiser
      Permanente health plan members (7,783 cases, 38,595 controls; 80.3% non-Hispanic 
      white, 4.9% African-American, 7.0% East Asian, and 7.8% Latino) revealed a new
      independent risk indel rs4646284 at the previously identified locus 6q25.3 that
      replicated in PEGASUS (N = 7,539) and the Multiethnic Cohort (N = 4,679) with an 
      overall P = 1.0 x 10(-19) (OR, 1.18). Across the 6q25.3 locus, rs4646284
      exhibited the strongest association with expression of SLC22A1 (P = 1.3 x
      10(-23)) and SLC22A3 (P = 3.2 x 10(-52)). At the known 19q13.33 locus, rs2659124 
      (P = 1.3 x 10(-13); OR, 1.18) nominally replicated in PEGASUS. A risk score of
      105 known risk SNPs was strongly associated with prostate cancer (P < 1.0 x
      10(-8)). Comparing the highest to lowest risk score deciles, the OR was 6.22 for 
      non-Hispanic whites, 5.82 for Latinos, 3.77 for African-Americans, and 3.38 for
      East Asians. In non-Hispanic whites, the 105 risk SNPs explained approximately
      7.6% of disease heritability. The entire GWAS array explained approximately 33.4%
      of heritability, with a 4.3-fold enrichment within DNaseI hypersensitivity sites 
      (P = 0.004). SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our findings of independent risk
      variants, ethnic variation in existing SNP replication, and remaining unexplained
      heritability have important implications for further clarifying the genetic risk 
      of prostate cancer. Our findings also suggest that there may be much promise in
      evaluating understudied variation, such as indels and ethnically diverse
      populations.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have identified
      23 susceptibility loci thus far. Analyses of previously conducted GWAS indicate
      additional risk loci are yet to be discovered. To identify novel CRC
      susceptibility loci, we conducted a new GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with
      five published GWAS (totalling 7,577 cases and 9,979 controls of European
      ancestry), imputing genotypes utilising the 1000 Genomes Project. The combined
      analysis identified new, significant associations with CRC at 1p36.2 marked by
      rs72647484 (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.09) near CDC42 and WNT4 (P = 1.21 x 
      10(-8), odds ratio [OR] = 1.21 ) and at 16q24.1 marked by rs16941835 (MAF = 0.21,
      P = 5.06 x 10(-8); OR = 1.15) within the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)
      RP11-58A18.1 and ~500 kb from the nearest coding gene FOXL1. Additionally we
      identified a promising association at 10p13 with rs10904849 intronic to CUBN (MAF
      = 0.32, P = 7.01 x 10(-8); OR = 1.14). These findings provide further insights
      into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CRC.
      Additionally, our analysis further demonstrates that imputation can be used to
      exploit GWAS data to identify novel disease-causing variants.

AB  - PURPOSE: Although most patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast
      cancer benefit from endocrine therapies, a significant proportion do not. Our aim
      was to identify inherited genetic variations that might predict survival among
      patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We
      performed a meta-analysis of two genome-wide studies; Helsinki Breast Cancer
      Study, 805 patients, with 240 receiving endocrine therapy and Prospective study
      of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer, 536 patients, with 155
      endocrine therapy patients, evaluating 486,478 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNP). The top four associations from the endocrine treatment subgroup were
      further investigated in two independent datasets totaling 5,011 patients, with
      3,485 receiving endocrine therapy. RESULTS: A meta-analysis identified a common
      SNP rs8113308, mapped to 19q13.41, associating with reduced survival among
      endocrine-treated patients [hazard ratio (HR), 1.69; 95% confidence interval
      (CI), 1.37-2.07; P = 6.34 x 10(-7)] and improved survival among ER-negative
      patients, with a similar trend in ER-positive cases not receiving endocrine
      therapy. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for conventional prognostic factors,
      we found a significant interaction between the rs8113308 and endocrine treatment,
      indicating a predictive, treatment-specific effect of the SNP rs8113308 on breast
      cancer survival, with the per-allele HR for interaction 2.16 (95% CI, 1.30-3.60; 
      Pinteraction = 0.003) and HR = 7.77 (95% CI, 0.93-64.71) for the homozygous
      genotype carriers. A biologic rationale is suggested by in silico functional
      analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest carrying the rs8113308 rare allele
      may identify patients who will not benefit from adjuvant endocrine treatment.

TI  - Genetic and clinical factors associated with obesity among adult survivors of
      childhood cancer: A report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort.
PG  - 2262-70
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29153 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to identify treatment and genetic
      factors associated with obesity among childhood cancer survivors. METHODS:
      Participants included 1996 survivors who previously received treatment for cancer
      at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and who survived >/=10 years from
      diagnosis (median age at diagnosis, 7.2 years; median age at follow-up, 32.4
      years). Obesity was defined as a body mass index >/=30 kg/m(2) . The factors
      associated with adult obesity were identified by subgroup-specific (cranial
      radiation [CRT] exposure status) multivariable logistic regression. Single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with obesity were identified by
      subgroup-specific, exploratory, genome-wide association analyses using a 2-stage 
      resampling approach with a type I error rate of 5 x 10(-6) . RESULTS: Forty-seven
      percent of survivors who received CRT and 29.4% of those who did not receive CRT 
      were obese at evaluation. In multivariable analyses, abdominal/pelvic radiation
      exposure was associated with decreased prevalence of obesity among survivors
      regardless of CRT status (P < .0001). The odds of obesity were increased among
      survivors who received CRT who had also received glucocorticoids (P = .014) or
      who were younger at diagnosis (P = .013). Among the survivors who had received
      CRT, 166 SNPs were associated with obesity. The strongest association was
      observed with reference SNP rs35669975 (P = 3.3 x 10(-8) ) on segment 33.3 of the
      long arm of chromosome 13 (13q33.3), approximately 30 kb downstream of FAM155A
      (family with sequence similarity 155, member A). SNPs within the glycine receptor
      alpha3 (GLRA3) gene and near the sex-determining region Y box 11 (SOX11) and
      cadherin 18 type 2 (CDH18) genes also were identified. These genes have been
      implicated in neural growth, repair, and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity in
      childhood cancer survivors remains associated with previous exposure to CRT and
      glucocorticoids. Genetic variants related to neural connectivity may modify the
      risk of obesity among survivors who receive CRT. Validation of these findings in 
      independent cohorts is required.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of susceptibility loci for breast cancer in
      Sardinian population.
PG  - 383
LID - 10.1186/s12885-015-1392-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite progress in identifying genes associated with breast cancer, 
      many more risk loci exist. Genome-wide association analyses in
      genetically-homogeneous populations, such as that of Sardinia (Italy), could
      represent an additional approach to detect low penetrance alleles. METHODS: We
      performed a genome-wide association study comparing 1431 Sardinian patients with 
      non-familial, BRCA1/2-mutation-negative breast cancer to 2171 healthy Sardinian
      blood donors. DNA was genotyped using GeneChip Human Mapping 500 K Arrays or
      Genome-Wide Human SNP Arrays 6.0. To increase genomic coverage, genotypes of
      additional SNPs were imputed using data from HapMap Phase II. After quality
      control filtering of genotype data, 1367 cases (9 men) and 1658 controls (1156
      men) were analyzed on a total of 2,067,645 SNPs. RESULTS: Overall, 33 genomic
      regions (67 candidate SNPs) were associated with breast cancer risk at the p <
      0(-6) level. Twenty of these regions contained defined genes, including one
      already associated with breast cancer risk: TOX3. With a lower threshold for
      preliminary significance to p < 10(-5), we identified 11 additional SNPs in
      FGFR2, a well-established breast cancer-associated gene. Ten candidate SNPs were 
      selected, excluding those already associated with breast cancer, for technical
      validation as well as replication in 1668 samples from the same population. Only 
      SNP rs345299, located in intron 1 of VAV3, remained suggestively associated
      (p-value, 1.16 x 10(-5)), but it did not associate with breast cancer risk in
      pooled data from two large, mixed-population cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      indicated the role of TOX3 and FGFR2 as breast cancer susceptibility genes in
      BRCA1/2-wild-type breast cancer patients from Sardinian population.

TI  - Two susceptibility loci identified for prostate cancer aggressiveness.
PG  - 6889
LID - 10.1038/ncomms7889 [doi]
AB  - Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer will experience indolent disease; hence, 
      discovering genetic variants that distinguish aggressive from nonaggressive
      prostate cancer is of critical clinical importance for disease prevention and
      treatment. In a multistage, case-only genome-wide association study of 12,518
      prostate cancer cases, we identify two loci associated with Gleason score, a
      pathological measure of disease aggressiveness: rs35148638 at 5q14.3 (RASA1,
      P=6.49 x 10(-9)) and rs78943174 at 3q26.31 (NAALADL2, P=4.18 x 10(-8)). In a
      stratified case-control analysis, the SNP at 5q14.3 appears specific for
      aggressive prostate cancer (P=8.85 x 10(-5)) with no association for
      nonaggressive prostate cancer compared with controls (P=0.57). The proximity of
      these loci to genes involved in vascular disease suggests potential biological
      mechanisms worthy of further investigation.

TI  - Identification of novel genetic markers of breast cancer survival.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djv081 [doi]
LID - djv081 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer varies considerably
      between patients, and some of this variation may be because of germline genetic
      variation. We aimed to identify genetic markers associated with breast
      cancer-specific survival. METHODS: We conducted a large meta-analysis of studies 
      in populations of European ancestry, including 37954 patients with 2900 deaths
      from breast cancer. Each study had been genotyped for between 200000 and 900000
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome; genotypes for nine
      million common variants were imputed using a common reference panel from the 1000
      Genomes Project. We also carried out subtype-specific analyses based on 6881
      estrogen receptor (ER)-negative patients (920 events) and 23059 ER-positive
      patients (1333 events). All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We
      identified one new locus (rs2059614 at 11q24.2) associated with survival in
      ER-negative breast cancer cases (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.95, 95% confidence
      interval [CI] = 1.55 to 2.47, P = 1.91 x 10(-8)). Genotyping a subset of 2113
      case patients, of which 300 were ER negative, provided supporting evidence for
      the quality of the imputation. The association in this set of case patients was
      stronger for the observed genotypes than for the imputed genotypes. A second
      locus (rs148760487 at 2q24.2) was associated at genome-wide statistical
      significance in initial analyses; the association was similar in ER-positive and 
      ER-negative case patients. Here the results of genotyping suggested that the
      finding was less robust. CONCLUSIONS: This is currently the largest study
      investigating genetic variation associated with breast cancer survival. Our
      results have potential clinical implications, as they confirm that germline
      genotype can provide prognostic information in addition to standard tumor

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the genetic variants associated with breast cancer survival,
      a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted of Korean breast cancer
      patients. METHODS: From the Seoul Breast Cancer Study (SEBCS), 3,226 patients
      with breast cancer (1,732 in the discovery and 1,494 in the replication set) were
      included in a two-stage GWAS on disease-free survival (DFS) by tumor subtypes
      based on hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER2). The associations of the re-classified combined prognostic markers through
      recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) of DFS for breast cancer were assessed with
      the Cox proportional hazard model. The prognostic predictive values of the
      clinical and genetic models were evaluated by Harrell's C. RESULTS: In the
      two-stage GWAS stratified by tumor subtypes, rs166870 and rs10825036 were
      consistently associated with DFS in the HR+ HER2- and HR- HER2- breast cancer
      subtypes, respectively (Prs166870 = 2.88 x 10(-7) and Prs10825036 = 3.54 x 10(-7)
      in the combined set). When patients were classified by the RPA in each subtype,
      genetic factors contributed significantly to differentiating the high risk group 
      associated with DFS inbreast cancer, specifically the HR+ HER2- (P discovery=1.18
      x 10(-8) and P replication = 2.08 x 10(-5)) and HR- HRE2- subtypes (P discovery =
      2.35 x 10(-4) and P replication = 2.60 x 10(-2)). The inclusion of the SNPs
      tended to improve the performance of the prognostic models consisting of age, TNM
      stage and tumor subtypes based on ER, PR, and HER2 status. CONCLUSION: Combined
      prognostic markers that include clinical and genetic factors by tumor subtypes
      could improve the prediction of survival in breast cancer.

LID - 10.1186/s40364-015-0031-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study we performed genome-wide association studies to
      identify candidate SNPs that may predict the risk of disease outcome in
      colorectal cancer. METHODS: Patient cohort consisted of 505 unrelated patients
      with Caucasian ancestry. Germline DNA samples were genotyped using the
      Illumina(R) human Omni-1quad SNP chip. Associations of SNPs with overall and
      disease free survivals were examined primarily for 431 patients with
      microsatellite instability-low (MSI-L) or stable (MSS) colorectal tumors using
      Cox proportional hazards method adjusting for clinical covariates. Bootstrap
      method was applied for internal validation of results. As exploratory analyses,
      association analyses for the colon (n = 334) and rectal (n = 171) cancer patients
      were also performed. RESULTS: As a result, there was no SNP that reached the
      genomewide significance levels (p < 5x10(-8)) in any of the analyses. A small
      number of genetic markers (n = 10) showed nominal associations (p <10(-6)) for
      MSS/MSI-L, colon, or rectal cancer patient groups. These markers were located in 
      two non-coding RNA genes or intergenic regions and none were amino acid
      substituting polymorphisms. Bootstrap analysis for the MSS/MSI-L cohort data
      suggested the robustness of the observed nominal associations. CONCLUSIONS:
      Likely due to small number of patients, our study did not identify an acceptable 
      level of association of SNPs with outcome in MSS/MSI-L, colon, or rectal cancer
      patients. A number of SNPs with sub-optimal p-values were, however, identified;
      these loci may be promising and examined in other larger-sized patient cohorts.

TI  - Thyroid cancer GWAS identifies 10q26.12 and 6q14.1 as novel susceptibility loci
      and reveals genetic heterogeneity among populations.
PG  - 1870-8

AB  - Thyroid cancer is the most heritable cancer of all those not displaying typical
      Mendelian inheritance. However, most of the genetic factors that would explain
      the high heritability remain unknown. Our aim was to identify additional common
      genetic variants associated with susceptibility to this disease. In order to do
      so, we performed a genome-wide association study in a series of 398 cases and 502
      controls from Spain, followed by a replication in four well-defined Southern
      European case-control collections contributing a total of 1,422 cases and 1,908
      controls. The association between the variation at the 9q22 locus near FOXE1 and 
      thyroid cancer risk was consistent across all series, with several SNPs
      identified (rs7028661: OR = 1.64, p = 1.0 x 10(-22) , rs7037324: OR = 1.54, p =
      1.2 x 10(-17) ). Moreover, the rare alleles of three SNPs (rs2997312, rs10788123 
      and rs1254167) at 10q26.12 showed suggestive evidence of association with higher 
      risk of the disease (OR = 1.35, p = 1.2 x 10(-04) , OR = 1.26, p = 5.2 x 10(-04) 
      and OR = 1.38, p = 5.9 x 10(-05) , respectively). Finally, the rare allele of
      rs4075570 at 6q14.1 conferred protection in the series studied (OR = 0.82, p =
      2.0 x 10(-04) ). This study suggests that heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility
      between populations is a key feature to take into account when exploring genetic 
      risk factors related to this disease.

      Indonesia.
PG  - 2231-5
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of the entire genome provide a systematic
      approach for revealing novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer.
      However, genetic association studies have hitherto been primarily conducted in
      women of European ancestry. Therefofre we here performed a pilot GWAS with a
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array 5.0 platform from Affymetrix(R) that
      contains 443,813 SNPs to search for new genetic risk factors in 89 breast cancer 
      cases and 46 healthy women of Indonesian ancestry. The case-control association
      of the GWAS finding set was evaluated using PLINK. The strengths of allelic and
      genotypic associations were assessed using logistic regression analysis and
      reported as odds ratios (ORs) and P values; P values less than 1.00x10(-8) and
      5.00x10(-5) were required for significant association and suggestive association,
      respectively. After analyzing 292,887 SNPs, we recognized 11 chromosome loci that
      possessed suggestive associations with breast cancer risk. Of these, however,
      there were only four chromosome loci with identified genes: chromosome 2p.12 with
      the CTNNA2 gene [Odds ratio (OR)=1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.13-1.33,
      P=1.08x10(-7)]; chromosome 18p11.2 with the SOGA2 gene (OR=1.32, 95%CI=1.17-1.44,
      P=6.88x10(-6)); chromosome 5q14.1 with the SSBP2 gene (OR=1.22, 95%CI=1.11-1.34, 
      P=4.00x10(-5)); and chromosome 9q31.1 with the TEX10 gene (OR=1.24,
      95%CI=1.12-1.35, P=4.68x10(-5)). This study identified 11 chromosome loci which
      exhibited suggestive associations with the risk of breast cancer among Indonesian
      women.

AB  - Platinum-induced myelosuppression severely impedes successful chemotherapy in
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Hence, it is clinically important to
      identify the patients who are at high risk for severe toxicity to certain
      chemotherapy. We first carried out a genome-wide scan of 906 703
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify genetic variants associated
      with platinum-induced myelosuppression risk in 333 NSCLC patients with
      chemotherapy. Then, we replicated 24 SNPs that had P<1 x 10(-4) in another
      independent cohort of 876 NSCLC patients. With P<0.05 as the criterion of
      statistical significance, we found that rs13014982 at 2q24.3 and rs9909179 at
      17p12 exhibited consistently significant associations with myelosuppression risk 
      in both the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) scan and the replication stage
      (rs13014982: odds ratio (OR)=0.55, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.41-0.74,
      P=7.29 x 10(-5) for GWAS scan and OR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.93, P=0.006 for
      replication stage; rs9909179: OR=0.51, 95% CI: 0.37-0.70, P=4.60 x 10(-5) for
      GWAS scan and OR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99, P=0.040 for replication stage; both in 
      additive model). In combined samples of genome-wide scan and replication samples,
      the minor alleles of rs13014982 and rs9909179 remained significant associations
      with the decreased risk of myelosuppression (rs13014982: OR=0.71, 95% CI:
      0.61-0.83, P =1.36 x 10(-5); rs9909179: OR=0.76, 95% CI: 0.65-0.89, P=0.001).
      Rs13014982 at 2q24.3 and rs9909179 at 17p12 might be independent susceptibility
      markers for platinum-induced myelosuppression risk in NSCLC patients.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To
      identify common genetic markers that may confer differential benefit from aspirin
      or NSAID chemoprevention, we tested gene x environment interactions between
      regular use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      in relation to risk of colorectal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
      Case-control study using data from 5 case-control and 5 cohort studies initiated 
      between 1976 and 2003 across the United States, Canada, Australia, and Germany
      and including colorectal cancer cases (n=8634) and matched controls (n=8553)
      ascertained between 1976 and 2011. Participants were all of European descent.
      EXPOSURES: Genome-wide SNP data and information on regular use of aspirin and/or 
      NSAIDs and other risk factors. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Colorectal cancer.
      RESULTS: Regular use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs was associated with lower risk of
      colorectal cancer (prevalence, 28% vs 38%; odds ratio [OR], 0.69 [95% CI,
      0.64-0.74]; P = 6.2 x 10(-28)) compared with nonregular use. In the conventional 
      logistic regression analysis, the SNP rs2965667 at chromosome 12p12.3 near the
      MGST1 gene showed a genome-wide significant interaction with aspirin and/or NSAID
      use (P = 4.6 x 10(-9) for interaction). Aspirin and/or NSAID use was associated
      with a lower risk of colorectal cancer among individuals with rs2965667-TT
      genotype (prevalence, 28% vs 38%; OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.61-0.70]; P = 7.7 x
      10(-33)) but with a higher risk among those with rare (4%) TA or AA genotypes
      (prevalence, 35% vs 29%; OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.27-2.81]; P = .002). In case-only
      interaction analysis, the SNP rs16973225 at chromosome 15q25.2 near the IL16 gene
      showed a genome-wide significant interaction with use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs (P
      = 8.2 x 10(-9) for interaction). Regular use was associated with a lower risk of 
      colorectal cancer among individuals with rs16973225-AA genotype (prevalence, 28% 
      vs 38%; OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.62-0.71]; P = 1.9 x 10(-30)) but was not associated
      with risk of colorectal cancer among those with less common (9%) AC or CC
      genotypes (prevalence, 36% vs 39%; OR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.78-1.20]; P = .76).
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this genome-wide investigation of gene x
      environment interactions, use of aspirin and/or NSAIDs was associated with lower 
      risk of colorectal cancer, and this association differed according to genetic
      variation at 2 SNPs at chromosomes 12 and 15. Validation of these findings in
      additional populations may facilitate targeted colorectal cancer prevention
      strategies.

TI  - Genome-wide association analysis of more than 120,000 individuals identifies 15
      new susceptibility loci for breast cancer.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large-scale replication studies have
      identified common variants in 79 loci associated with breast cancer, explaining
      approximately 14% of the familial risk of the disease. To identify new
      susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 GWAS, comprising 15,748
      breast cancer cases and 18,084 controls together with 46,785 cases and 42,892
      controls from 41 studies genotyped on a 211,155-marker custom array (iCOGS).
      Analyses were restricted to women of European ancestry. We generated genotypes
      for more than 11 million SNPs by imputation using the 1000 Genomes Project
      reference panel, and we identified 15 new loci associated with breast cancer at P
      < 5 x 10(-8). Combining association analysis with ChIP-seq chromatin binding data
      in mammary cell lines and ChIA-PET chromatin interaction data from ENCODE, we
      identified likely target genes in two regions: SETBP1 at 18q12.3 and RNF115 and
      PDZK1 at 1q21.1. One association appears to be driven by an amino acid
      substitution encoded in EXO1.

TI  - Identification of six new susceptibility loci for invasive epithelial ovarian
      cancer.
PG  - 164-71
LID - 10.1038/ng.3185 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 12 epithelial ovarian
      cancer (EOC) susceptibility alleles. The pattern of association at these loci is 
      consistent in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers who are at high risk of EOC.
      After imputation to 1000 Genomes Project data, we assessed associations of 11
      million genetic variants with EOC risk from 15,437 cases unselected for family
      history and 30,845 controls and from 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 8,211
      BRCA2 mutation carriers (3,096 with ovarian cancer), and we combined the results 
      in a meta-analysis. This new study design yielded increased statistical power,
      leading to the discovery of six new EOC susceptibility loci. Variants at 1p36
      (nearest gene, WNT4), 4q26 (SYNPO2), 9q34.2 (ABO) and 17q11.2 (ATAD5) were
      associated with EOC risk, and at 1p34.3 (RSPO1) and 6p22.1 (GPX6) variants were
      specifically associated with the serous EOC subtype, all with P < 5 x 10(-8).
      Incorporating these variants into risk assessment tools will improve clinical
      risk predictions for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Genome wide association studies (GWAs) of breast cancer mortality have
      identified few potential associations. The concordance between these studies is
      unclear. In this study, we used a meta-analysis of two prognostic GWAs and a
      replication cohort to identify the strongest associations and to evaluate the
      loci suggested in previous studies. We attempt to identify those SNPs which could
      impact overall survival irrespective of the age of onset. METHODS: To facilitate 
      the meta-analysis and to refine the association signals, SNPs were imputed using 
      data from the 1000 genomes project. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to
      estimate hazard ratios (HR) in 536 patients from the POSH cohort (Prospective
      study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer) and 805 patients
      from the HEBCS cohort (Helsinki Breast Cancer Study). These hazard ratios were
      combined using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects meta-analysis and a p-value
      threshold of 5x10(-8) was used to determine significance. Replication was
      performed in 1523 additional patients from the POSH study. RESULTS: Although no
      SNPs achieved genome wide significance, three SNPs have significant association
      in the replication cohort and combined p-values less than 5.6x10(-6). These SNPs 
      are; rs421379 which is 556 kb upstream of ARRDC3 (HR = 1.49, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) = 1.27-1.75, P = 1.1x10(-6)), rs12358475 which is between ECHDC3
      and PROSER2 (HR = 0.75, CI = 0.67-0.85, P = 1.8x10(-6)), and rs1728400 which is
      between LINC00917 and FOXF1. CONCLUSIONS: In a genome wide meta-analysis of two
      independent cohorts from UK and Finland, we identified potential associations at 
      three distinct loci. Phenotypic heterogeneity and relatively small sample sizes
      may explain the lack of genome wide significant findings. However, the
      replication at three SNPs in the validation cohort shows promise for future
      studies in larger cohorts. We did not find strong evidence for concordance
      between the few associations highlighted by previous GWAs of breast cancer
      survival and this study.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of breast cancer in Latinas identifies novel
      protective variants on 6q25.
PG  - 5260
LID - 10.1038/ncomms6260 [doi]
AB  - The genetic contributions to breast cancer development among Latinas are not well
      understood. Here we carry out a genome-wide association study of breast cancer in
      Latinas and identify a genome-wide significant risk variant, located 5' of the
      Estrogen Receptor 1 gene (ESR1; 6q25 region). The minor allele for this variant
      is strongly protective (rs140068132: odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.53-0.67, P=9 x 10(-18)), originates from Indigenous Americans and
      is uncorrelated with previously reported risk variants at 6q25. The association
      is stronger for oestrogen receptor-negative disease (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21-0.54)
      than oestrogen receptor-positive disease (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.80; P
      heterogeneity=0.01) and is also associated with mammographic breast density, a
      strong risk factor for breast cancer (P=0.001). rs140068132 is located within
      several transcription factor-binding sites and electrophoretic mobility shift
      assays with MCF-7 nuclear protein demonstrate differential binding of the G/A
      alleles at this locus. These results highlight the importance of conducting
      research in diverse populations.

AB  - Through genome-wide association analysis and an independent replication study
      using a total of 1131 bladder cancer cases and 12 558 non-cancer controls of
      Japanese populations, we identified a susceptibility locus on chromosome 15q24.
      SNP rs11543198 was associated with bladder cancer risk with odds ratio (OR) of
      1.41 and P-value of 4.03 x 10(-9). Subgroup analysis revealed rs11543198 to have 
      a stronger effect in male smokers with OR of 1.66. SNP rs8041357, which is in
      complete linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 1) with rs11543198, was also associated
      with bladder cancer risk in Europeans (P = 0.045 for an additive and P = 0.025
      for a recessive model), despite much lower minor allele frequency in Europeans
      (3.7%) compared with the Japanese (22.2%). Imputational analysis in this region
      suggested CYP1A2, which metabolizes tobacco-derived carcinogen, as a causative
      candidate gene. We also confirmed the association of previously reported loci,
      namely SLC14A1, APOBEC3A, PSCA and MYC, with bladder cancer. Our finding implies 
      the crucial roles of genetic variations on the chemically associated development 
      of bladder cancer.

TI  - A meta-analysis of 87,040 individuals identifies 23 new susceptibility loci for
      prostate cancer.
PG  - 1103-9
LID - 10.1038/ng.3094 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 76 variants associated
      with prostate cancer risk predominantly in populations of European ancestry. To
      identify additional susceptibility loci for this common cancer, we conducted a
      meta-analysis of > 10 million SNPs in 43,303 prostate cancer cases and 43,737
      controls from studies in populations of European, African, Japanese and Latino
      ancestry. Twenty-three new susceptibility loci were identified at association P <
      5 x 10(-8); 15 variants were identified among men of European ancestry, 7 were
      identified in multi-ancestry analyses and 1 was associated with early-onset
      prostate cancer. These 23 variants, in combination with known prostate cancer
      risk variants, explain 33% of the familial risk for this disease in
      European-ancestry populations. These findings provide new regions for
      investigation into the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and demonstrate the
      usefulness of combining ancestrally diverse populations to discover risk loci for
      disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calcium intake may reduce risk of colorectal cancer, but the
      mechanisms remain unclear. Studies of interaction between calcium intake and SNPs
      in calcium-related pathways have yielded inconsistent results. METHODS: To
      identify gene-calcium interactions, we tested interactions between approximately 
      2.7 million SNPs across the genome with self-reported calcium intake (from
      dietary or supplemental sources) in 9,006 colorectal cancer cases and 9,503
      controls of European ancestry. To test for multiplicative interactions, we used
      multivariable logistic regression and defined statistical significance using the 
      conventional genome-wide alpha = 5E-08. RESULTS: After accounting for multiple
      comparisons, there were no statistically significant SNP interactions with total,
      dietary, or supplemental calcium intake. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence of SNP
      interactions with calcium intake for colorectal cancer risk in a large population
      of 18,509 individuals. IMPACT: These results suggest that in genome-wide analysis
      common genetic variants do not strongly modify the association between calcium
      intake and colorectal cancer in European populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is the
      leading cause of cancer-related deaths all over the world. Studies have indicated
      that molecular biomarkers, including genetic variants, may provide additional
      values for the targeted treatments and clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients. To
      better understand the effects of molecular biomarkers on the treatment of NSCLC, 
      we conducted a genome-wide analysis to investigate the prognostic implications of
      genetic variants in early-stage NSCLC patients with surgery. METHODS: A genome
      wide scan of 906,703 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted in a
      cohort with 365 early-stage NSCLC patients with surgery, followed by a fast-track
      replication in another independent cohort of 327 NSCLC patients from Nanjing,
      China. Cox models were used to screen and validate significant SNPs associated
      with the overall survival of early-stage NSCLC patients. RESULTS: We found that
      rs10023113 in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II delta (CAMK2D) was
      consistently associated with survival of early-stage NSCLC in the GWAS scan and
      the replication cohort [GWAS scan: hazard ratio (HR) 2.84; 95 % confidence
      interval (CI) 1.90-4.23, P = 1.29 x 10(-6); replication cohort: HR 2.19, 95 % CI 
      1.15-4.21, P = 1.80 x 10(-2)]. When combining all the patients, the results
      showed that the variant allele of rs10023113 was significantly associated with
      poor prognosis of early-stage NSCLC with P value of 3.40 x 10(-7) (HR 2.30, 95 % 
      CI 1.67-3.17). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CAMK2D rs10023113 may be 
      a potentially prognostic marker for overall survival of early-stage NSCLC
      patients in Chinese population.

AB  - Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynaecological malignancies
      worldwide. Here we perform a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 
      Han Chinese women to identify risk genetic variants for epithelial ovarian cancer
      (EOC). We scan 900,015 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,057 EOC cases 
      and 1,191 controls in stage I, and replicate 41 SNPs (P(meta)<10(-4)) in 960 EOC 
      cases and 1,799 controls (stage II), and an additional 492 EOC cases and 1,004
      controls (stage III). Finally, we identify two EOC susceptibility loci at 9q22.33
      (rs1413299 in COL15A1, P(meta) = 1.88 x 10(-8)) and 10p11.21 (rs1192691 near
      ANKRD30A, P(meta) = 2.62 x 10(-8)), and two consistently replicated loci at
      12q14.2 (rs11175194 in SRGAP1, P(meta) = 1.14 x 10(-7)) and 9q34.2 (rs633862 near
      ABO and SURF6, P(meta) = 8.57 x 10(-7)) (P<0.05 in all three stages). These
      results may advance our understanding of genetic susceptibility to EOC.

TI  - Genetic variant predicts bevacizumab-induced hypertension in ECOG-5103 and
      ECOG-2100.
PG  - 1241-8
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2014.430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab has broad anti-tumour activity, but substantial risk of
      hypertension. No reliable markers are available for predicting
      bevacizumab-induced hypertension. METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS)
      was performed in the phase III bevacizumab-based adjuvant breast cancer trial,
      ECOG-5103, to evaluate for an association between genotypes and hypertension.
      GWAS was conducted in those who had experienced systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      >160 mm Hg during therapy using binary analysis and a cumulative dose model for
      the total exposure of bevacizumab. Common toxicity criteria (CTC) grade 3-5
      hypertension was also assessed. Candidate SNP validation was performed in the
      randomised phase III trial, ECOG-2100. RESULTS: When using the phenotype of
      SBP>160 mm Hg, the most significant association in SV2C (rs6453204) approached
      and met genome-wide significance in the binary model (P=6.0 x 10(-8); OR=3.3) and
      in the cumulative dose model (P=4.7 x 10(-8); HR=2.2), respectively. Similar
      associations with rs6453204 were seen for CTC grade 3-5 hypertension but did not 
      meet genome-wide significance. Validation study from ECOG-2100 demonstrated a
      statistically significant association between this SNP and grade 3/4 hypertension
      using the binary model (P-value=0.037; OR=2.4). CONCLUSIONS: A genetic variant in
      SV2C predicted clinically relevant bevacizumab-induced hypertension in two
      independent, randomised phase III trials.

      susceptibility locus in VTI1A.
PG  - 4613
LID - 10.1038/ncomms5613 [doi]
AB  - The genetic basis of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) is not well explained by
      known risk polymorphisms. Here we perform a meta-analysis of two genome-wide
      association studies in 2,627 cases and 3,797 controls of Japanese ancestry and
      1,894 cases and 4,703 controls of African ancestry, to identify genetic variants 
      that contribute to CRC susceptibility. We replicate genome-wide statistically
      significant associations (P<5 x 10(-8)) in 16,823 cases and 18,211 controls of
      European ancestry. This study reveals a new pan-ethnic CRC risk locus at 10q25
      (rs12241008, intronic to VTI1A; P=1.4 x 10(-9)), providing additional insight
      into the aetiology of CRC and highlighting the value of association mapping in
      diverse populations.

AB  - We performed a multistage genome-wide association study including 7,683
      individuals with pancreatic cancer and 14,397 controls of European descent. Four 
      new loci reached genome-wide significance: rs6971499 at 7q32.3 (LINC-PINT,
      per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.84, P =
      3.0 x 10(-12)), rs7190458 at 16q23.1 (BCAR1/CTRB1/CTRB2, OR = 1.46, 95% CI
      1.30-1.65, P = 1.1 x 10(-10)), rs9581943 at 13q12.2 (PDX1, OR = 1.15, 95% CI
      1.10-1.20, P = 2.4 x 10(-9)) and rs16986825 at 22q12.1 (ZNRF3, OR = 1.18, 95% CI 
      1.12-1.25, P = 1.2 x 10(-8)). We identified an independent signal in exon 2 of
      TERT at the established region 5p15.33 (rs2736098, OR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.85, P
      = 9.8 x 10(-14)). We also identified a locus at 8q24.21 (rs1561927, P = 1.3 x
      10(-7)) that approached genome-wide significance located 455 kb telomeric of
      PVT1. Our study identified multiple new susceptibility alleles for pancreatic
      cancer that are worthy of follow-up studies.

TI  - Genome-wide association analysis in East Asians identifies breast cancer
      susceptibility loci at 1q32.1, 5q14.3 and 15q26.1.
PG  - 886-90
LID - 10.1038/ng.3041 [doi]
AB  - In a three-stage genome-wide association study among East Asian women including
      22,780 cases and 24,181 controls, we identified 3 genetic loci newly associated
      with breast cancer risk, including rs4951011 at 1q32.1 (in intron 2 of the
      ZC3H11A gene; P=8.82x10(-9)), rs10474352 at 5q14.3 (near the ARRDC3 gene;
      P=1.67x10(-9)) and rs2290203 at 15q26.1 (in intron 14 of the PRC1 gene;
      P=4.25x10(-8)). We replicated these associations in 16,003 cases and 41,335
      controls of European ancestry (P=0.030, 0.004 and 0.010, respectively). Data from
      the ENCODE Project suggest that variants rs4951011 and rs10474352 might be
      located in an enhancer region and transcription factor binding sites,
      respectively. This study provides additional insights into the genetics and
      biology of breast cancer.

TI  - A novel colorectal cancer risk locus at 4q32.2 identified from an international
      genome-wide association study.

AB  - Only a fraction of colorectal cancer heritability is explained by known
      risk-conferring genetic variation. This study was designed to identify novel risk
      alleles in Europeans. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS)
      meta-analysis of colorectal cancer in participants from a population-based
      case-control study in Israel (n = 1616 cases, 1329 controls) and a consortium
      study from the Colon Cancer Family Registry (n = 1977 cases, 999 controls). We
      used a two-stage (discovery-replication) GWAS design, followed by a joint
      meta-analysis. A combined analysis identified a novel susceptibility locus that
      reached genome-wide significance on chromosome 4q32.2 [rs35509282, risk allele = 
      A (minor allele frequency = 0.09); odds ratio (OR) per risk allele = 1.53; P
      value = 8.2 x 10(-9); nearest gene = FSTL5]. The direction of the association was
      consistent across studies. In addition, we confirmed that 14 of 29 previously
      identified susceptibility variants were significantly associated with risk of
      colorectal cancer in this study. Genetic variation on chromosome 4q32.2 is
      significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer in Ashkenazi Jews and
      Europeans in this study.

PG  - 891-4
LID - 10.1038/ng.3020 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing evidence supporting the role of genetic variants in the
      development of radiation-induced toxicity. However, previous candidate gene
      association studies failed to elucidate the common genetic variation underlying
      this phenotype, which could emerge years after the completion of treatment. We
      performed a genome-wide association study on a Spanish cohort of 741 individuals 
      with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). The
      replication cohorts consisted of 633 cases from the UK and 368 cases from North
      America. One locus comprising TANC1 (lowest unadjusted P value for overall late
      toxicity=6.85x10(-9), odds ratio (OR)=6.61, 95% confidence interval
      (CI)=2.23-19.63) was replicated in the second stage (lowest unadjusted P value
      for overall late toxicity=2.08x10(-4), OR=6.17, 95% CI=2.25-16.95;
      Pcombined=4.16x10(-10)). The inclusion of the third cohort gave unadjusted
      Pcombined=4.64x10(-11). These results, together with the role of TANC1 in
      regenerating damaged muscle, suggest that the TANC1 locus influences the
      development of late radiation-induced damage.

TI  - Rare variants of large effect in BRCA2 and CHEK2 affect risk of lung cancer.
PG  - 736-41
LID - 10.1038/ng.3002 [doi]
AB  - We conducted imputation to the 1000 Genomes Project of four genome-wide
      association studies of lung cancer in populations of European ancestry (11,348
      cases and 15,861 controls) and genotyped an additional 10,246 cases and 38,295
      controls for follow-up. We identified large-effect genome-wide associations for
      squamous lung cancer with the rare variants BRCA2 p.Lys3326X (rs11571833, odds
      ratio (OR) = 2.47, P = 4.74 x 10(-20)) and CHEK2 p.Ile157Thr (rs17879961, OR =
      0.38, P = 1.27 x 10(-13)). We also showed an association between common variation
      at 3q28 (TP63, rs13314271, OR = 1.13, P = 7.22 x 10(-10)) and lung adenocarcinoma
      that had been previously reported only in Asians. These findings provide further 
      evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and its biological
      basis. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that imputation can identify rare 
      disease-causing variants with substantive effects on cancer risk from preexisting
      genome-wide association study data.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of urinary bladder cancer (UBC) have
      yielded common variants at 12 loci that associate with risk of the disease. We
      report here the results of a GWAS of UBC including 1670 UBC cases and 90 180
      controls, followed by replication analysis in additional 5266 UBC cases and 10
      456 controls. We tested a dataset containing 34.2 million variants, generated by 
      imputation based on whole-genome sequencing of 2230 Icelanders. Several
      correlated variants at 20p12, represented by rs62185668, show genome-wide
      significant association with UBC after combining discovery and replication
      results (OR = 1.19, P = 1.5 x 10(-11) for rs62185668-A, minor allele frequency = 
      23.6%). The variants are located in a non-coding region approximately 300 kb
      upstream from the JAG1 gene, an important component of the Notch signaling
      pathways that may be oncogenic or tumor suppressive in several forms of cancer.
      Our results add to the growing number of UBC risk variants discovered through
      GWAS.

AB  - Known genetic loci explain only a small proportion of the familial relative risk 
      of colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a genome-wide association study of CRC
      in East Asians with 14,963 cases and 31,945 controls and identified 6 new loci
      associated with CRC risk (P = 3.42 x 10(-8) to 9.22 x 10(-21)) at 10q22.3,
      10q25.2, 11q12.2, 12p13.31, 17p13.3 and 19q13.2. Two of these loci map to genes
      (TCF7L2 and TGFB1) with established roles in colorectal tumorigenesis. Four other
      loci are located in or near genes involved in transcriptional regulation (ZMIZ1),
      genome maintenance (FEN1), fatty acid metabolism (FADS1 and FADS2), cancer cell
      motility and metastasis (CD9), and cell growth and differentiation (NXN). We also
      found suggestive evidence for three additional loci associated with CRC risk near
      genome-wide significance at 8q24.11, 10q21.1 and 10q24.2. Furthermore, we
      replicated 22 previously reported CRC-associated loci. Our study provides
      insights into the genetic basis of CRC and suggests the involvement of new
      biological pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify common single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with toxicity 2years after
      radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A genome wide association study was
      performed in 1850 patients from the RAPPER study: 1217 received adjuvant breast
      radiotherapy and 633 had radical prostate radiotherapy. Genotype associations
      with both overall and individual endpoints of toxicity were tested via
      univariable and multivariable regression. Replication of potentially associated
      SNPs was carried out in three independent patient cohorts who had radiotherapy
      for prostate (516 RADIOGEN and 862 Gene-PARE) or breast (355 LeND) cancer.
      RESULTS: Quantile-quantile plots show more associations at the P<5x10(-7) level
      than expected by chance (164 vs. 9 for the prostate cases and 29 vs. 4 for breast
      cases), providing evidence that common genetic variants are associated with risk 
      of toxicity. Strongest associations were for individual endpoints rather than an 
      overall measure of toxicity in all patients. However, in general, significant
      associations were not validated at a nominal 0.05 level in the replication
      cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This largest GWAS to date provides evidence of true
      association between common genetic variants and toxicity. Associations with
      toxicity appeared to be tumour site-specific. Future GWAS require higher
      statistical power, in particular in the validation stage, to test clinically
      relevant effect sizes of SNP associations with individual endpoints, but the
      required sample sizes are achievable.

      might arise from associations of these SNPs with circulating prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) because PSA values are used to select controls. METHODS: We
      undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of screen-detected prostate
      cancer (ProtecT: 1,146 cases and 1,804 controls); meta-analyzed the results with 
      those from the previously published UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study (1,854 cases
      and 1,437 controls); investigated associations of SNPs with prostate cancer using
      either "low" (PSA < 0.5 ng/mL) or "high" (PSA >/= 3 ng/mL, biopsy negative) PSA
      controls; and investigated associations of SNPs with PSA. RESULTS: The ProtecT
      GWAS confirmed previously reported associations of prostate cancer at three loci:
      10q11.23, 17q24.3, and 19q13.33. The meta-analysis confirmed associations of
      prostate cancer with SNPs near four previously identified loci (8q24.21,10q11.23,
      17q24.3, and 19q13.33). When comparing prostate cancer cases with low PSA
      controls, alleles at genetic markers rs1512268, rs445114, rs10788160, rs11199874,
      rs17632542, rs266849, and rs2735839 were associated with an increased risk of
      prostate cancer, but the effect-estimates were attenuated to the null when using 
      high PSA controls (Pheterogeneity in effect-estimates < 0.04). We found a novel
      inverse association of rs9311171-T with circulating PSA. CONCLUSIONS: Differences
      in effect-estimates for prostate cancer observed when comparing low versus high
      PSA controls may be explained by associations of these SNPs with PSA. IMPACT:
      These findings highlight the need for inferences from genetic studies of prostate
      cancer risk to carefully consider the influence of control selection criteria.

AB  - Dietary factors, including meat, fruits, vegetables and fiber, are associated
      with colorectal cancer; however, there is limited information as to whether these
      dietary factors interact with genetic variants to modify risk of colorectal
      cancer. We tested interactions between these dietary factors and approximately
      2.7 million genetic variants for colorectal cancer risk among 9,287 cases and
      9,117 controls from ten studies. We used logistic regression to investigate
      multiplicative gene-diet interactions, as well as our recently developed Cocktail
      method that involves a screening step based on marginal associations and
      gene-diet correlations and a testing step for multiplicative interactions, while 
      correcting for multiple testing using weighted hypothesis testing. Per quartile
      increment in the intake of red and processed meat were associated with
      statistically significant increased risks of colorectal cancer and vegetable,
      fruit and fiber intake with lower risks. From the case-control analysis, we
      detected a significant interaction between rs4143094 (10p14/near GATA3) and
      processed meat consumption (OR = 1.17; p = 8.7E-09), which was consistently
      observed across studies (p heterogeneity = 0.78). The risk of colorectal cancer
      associated with processed meat was increased among individuals with the
      rs4143094-TG and -TT genotypes (OR = 1.20 and OR = 1.39, respectively) and null
      among those with the GG genotype (OR = 1.03). Our results identify a novel
      gene-diet interaction with processed meat for colorectal cancer, highlighting
      that diet may modify the effect of genetic variants on disease risk, which may
      have important implications for prevention.

AB  - Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause
      of cancer related mortality for men in the United States. There is strong
      empirical and epidemiological evidence supporting a stronger role of genetics in 
      early-onset prostate cancer. We performed a genome-wide association scan for
      early-onset prostate cancer. Novel aspects of this study include the focus on
      early-onset disease (defined as men with prostate cancer diagnosed before age 56 
      years) and use of publically available control genotype data from previous
      genome-wide association studies. We found genome-wide significant (p<5x10(-8))
      evidence for variants at 8q24 and 11p15 and strong supportive evidence for a
      number of previously reported loci. We found little evidence for individual or
      systematic inflated association findings resulting from using public controls,
      demonstrating the utility of using public control data in large-scale genetic
      association studies of common variants. Taken together, these results demonstrate
      the importance of established common genetic variants for early-onset prostate
      cancer and the power of including early-onset prostate cancer cases in genetic
      association studies.

AB  - To identify common variants influencing colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, we
      performed a meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies, comprising
      5626 cases and 7817 controls of European descent. We conducted replication of top
      ranked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in additional series totalling 14
      037 cases and 15 937 controls, identifying a new CRC risk locus at 10q24.2
      [rs1035209; odds ratio (OR) = 1.13, P = 4.54 x 10(-11)]. We also performed
      meta-analysis of our studies, with previously published data, of several recently
      purported CRC risk loci. We failed to find convincing evidence for a previously
      reported genome-wide association at rs11903757 (2q32.3). Of the three additional 
      loci for which evidence of an association in Europeans has been previously
      described we failed to show an association between rs59336 (12q24.21) and CRC
      risk. However, for the other two SNPs, our analyses demonstrated new, formally
      significant associations with CRC. These are rs3217810 intronic in CCND2
      (12p13.32; OR = 1.19, P = 2.16 x 10(-10)) and rs10911251 near LAMC1 (1q25.3; OR =
      1.09, P = 1.75 x 10(-8)). Additionally, we found some evidence to support a
      relationship between, rs647161, rs2423297 and rs10774214 and CRC risk originally 
      identified in East Asians in our European datasets. Our findings provide further 
      insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic
      susceptibility to CRC.

AB  - PURPOSE: Postoperative recurrence in stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      is the major cause of a poor prognosis. This study aims to identify genetic
      variants that are associated with the prognosis of early-stage NSCLCs.
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted in 250 
      patients in stage I NSCLCs and the results were replicated in additional 308
      patients. RESULTS: Results from an Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP array in 250 
      patients identified 94 SNPs with significant associations (P < 2 x 10(-4)), which
      were selected for replication in 308 additional patients. Pooled analysis of the 
      558 patients determined that rs1454694 in chromosome 4q34 was the most
      significant marker of lung cancer prognosis in the stage I patients (adjusted HR 
      = 2.81; P = 5.91 x 10(-8)). After the candidate loci were mapped, an additional
      four markers at chromosome 4q34.3 were significantly associated with
      recurrence-free survival (RFS; P < 5 x 10(-5)). A haplotype of five SNPs in 4q34 
      also showed significant association with RFS (P = 4.29 x 10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      genetic polymorphism rs1454694 was identified as a novel genetic risk factor for 
      RFS of stage I NSCLCs. This genome-wide study suggests that genetic markers in
      4q34.3 contribute to predict the prognosis of Korean patients with stage I
      NSCLCs.

AB  - One of the important factors influencing the development of uterine cervical
      cancer is human papillomavirus infection in women. Usually, the infecting
      papillomavirus is eliminated from individuals; however, some retain the virus and
      this is believed to lead to the development of uterine cervical cancer. It is
      possible that virus elimination or persistent infection depends on an
      individual's genetic background. To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms
      associated with susceptibility to persistent infection or cervical cancer, a
      genome-wide association study was performed on 226 cases and 186 controls. Some
      of the single nucleotide polymorphisms showed a P-value < 10(-5); however, no
      polymorphisms that were significantly associated with susceptibility to cervical 
      cancer were identified.

      from the National Cancer Institute Bladder Cancer GWAS. Alternative methods were 
      used to evaluate both additive and multiplicative interactions between individual
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and smoking exposure. SNPs with
      interaction P values < 5 x 10(-) (5) were evaluated further in an independent
      dataset of 2422 bladder cancer cases and 5751 controls. We identified 10 SNPs
      that showed association in a consistent manner with the initial dataset and in
      the combined dataset, providing evidence of interaction with tobacco use.
      Further, two of these novel SNPs showed strong evidence of association with
      bladder cancer in tobacco use subgroups that approached genome-wide significance.
      Specifically, rs1711973 (FOXF2) on 6p25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for never
      smokers [combined odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
      1.20-1.50, P value = 5.18 x 10(-) (7)]; and rs12216499 (RSPH3-TAGAP-EZR) on
      6q25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for ever smokers (combined OR = 0.75, 95% CI =
      0.67-0.84, P value = 6.35 x 10(-) (7)). In our analysis of smoking and bladder
      cancer, the tests for multiplicative interaction seemed to more commonly identify
      susceptibility loci with associations in never smokers, whereas the additive
      interaction analysis identified more loci with associations among
      smokers-including the known smoking and NAT2 acetylation interaction. Our
      findings provide additional evidence of gene-environment interactions for tobacco
      and bladder cancer.

TI  - A genome-wide gene-environment interaction analysis for tobacco smoke and lung
      cancer susceptibility.
PG  - 1528-35
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgu076 [doi]
AB  - Tobacco smoke is the major environmental risk factor underlying lung
      carcinogenesis. However, approximately one-tenth smokers develop lung cancer in
      their lifetime indicating there is significant individual variation in
      susceptibility to lung cancer. And, the reasons for this are largely unknown. In 
      particular, the genetic variants discovered in genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS) account for only a small fraction of the phenotypic variations for lung
      cancer, and gene-environment interactions are thought to explain the missing
      fraction of disease heritability. The ability to identify smokers at high risk of
      developing cancer has substantial preventive implications. Thus, we undertook a
      gene-smoking interaction analysis in a GWAS of lung cancer in Han Chinese
      population using a two-phase designed case-control study. In the discovery phase,
      we evaluated all pair-wise (591 370) gene-smoking interactions in 5408 subjects
      (2331 cases and 3077 controls) using a logistic regression model with covariate
      adjustment. In the replication phase, promising interactions were validated in an
      independent population of 3023 subjects (1534 cases and 1489 controls). We
      identified interactions between two single nucleotide polymorphisms and smoking. 
      The interaction P values are 6.73 x 10(-) (6) and 3.84 x 10(-) (6) for rs1316298 
      and rs4589502, respectively, in the combined dataset from the two phases. An
      antagonistic interaction (rs1316298-smoking) and a synergetic interaction
      (rs4589502-smoking) were observed. The two interactions identified in our study
      may help explain some of the missing heritability in lung cancer susceptibility
      and present strong evidence for further study of these gene-smoking interactions,
      which are benefit to intensive screening and smoking cessation interventions.

AB  - Early-onset breast cancer (EOBC) causes substantial loss of life and
      productivity, creating a major burden among women worldwide. We analyzed
      1,265,548 Hapmap3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among a discovery set of 
      3,523 EOBC incident cases and 2,702 population control women ages </= 51 years.
      The SNPs with smallest P values were examined in a replication set of 3,470 EOBC 
      cases and 5,475 control women. We also tested EOBC association with 19,684 genes 
      by annotating each gene with putative functional SNPs, and then combining their P
      values to obtain a gene-based P value. We examined the gene with smallest P value
      for replication in 1,145 breast cancer cases and 1,142 control women. The
      combined discovery and replication sets identified 72 new SNPs associated with
      EOBC (P < 4 x 10(-8)) located in six genomic regions previously reported to
      contain SNPs associated largely with later-onset breast cancer (LOBC). SNP
      rs2229882 and 10 other SNPs on chromosome 5q11.2 remained associated (P < 6 x
      10(-4)) after adjustment for the strongest published SNPs in the region.
      Thirty-two of the 82 currently known LOBC SNPs were associated with EOBC (P <
      0.05). Low power is likely responsible for the remaining 50 unassociated known
      LOBC SNPs. The gene-based analysis identified an association between breast
      cancer and the phosphofructokinase-muscle (PFKM) gene on chromosome 12q13.11 that
      met the genome-wide gene-based threshold of 2.5 x 10(-6). In conclusion, EOBC and
      LOBC seem to have similar genetic etiologies; the 5q11.2 region may contain
      multiple distinct breast cancer loci; and the PFKM gene region is worthy of
      further investigation. These findings should enhance our understanding of the
      etiology of breast cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies a new SMAD7 risk variant associated with

PG  - 948-55

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have been
      conducted primarily in European descendants. In a GWAS conducted in East Asians, 
      we first analyzed approximately 1.7 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) in four studies with 1,773 CRC cases and 2,642 controls. We then selected 
      66 promising SNPs for replication and genotyped them in three independent studies
      with 3,612 cases and 3,523 controls. Five SNPs were further evaluated using data 
      from four additional studies including up to 3,290 cases and 4,339 controls. SNP 
      rs7229639 in the SMAD7 gene was found to be associated with CRC risk with an odds
      ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with the minor allele (A) of 1.22
      (1.15-1.29) in the combined analysis of all 11 studies (p = 2.93 x 10(-11) ). SNP
      rs7229639 is 2,487 bp upstream from rs4939827, a risk variant identified
      previously in a European-ancestry GWAS in relation to CRC risk. However, these
      two SNPs are not correlated in East Asians (r(2) = 0.008) nor in Europeans (r(2) 
      = 0.146). The CRC association with rs7229639 remained statistically significant
      after adjusting for rs4939827 as well as three additional CRC risk variants
      (rs58920878, rs12953717 and rs4464148) reported previously in this region. SNPs
      rs7229639 and rs4939827 explained approximately 1% of the familial relative risk 
      of CRC in East Asians. This study identifies a new CRC risk variant in the SMAD7 
      gene, further highlighting the significant role of this gene in the etiology of
      CRC.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies 25 known breast cancer susceptibility
      loci as risk factors for triple-negative breast cancer.
PG  - 1012-9
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgt404 [doi]
AB  - Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer
      associated with a unique set of epidemiologic and genetic risk factors. We
      conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of TN breast cancer (stage 1:
      1529 TN cases, 3399 controls; stage 2: 2148 cases, 1309 controls) to identify
      loci that influence TN breast cancer risk. Variants in the 19p13.1 and PTHLH loci
      showed genome-wide significant associations (P < 5 x 10(-) (8)) in stage 1 and 2 
      combined. Results also suggested a substantial enrichment of significantly
      associated variants among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed in 
      stage 2. Variants from 25 of 74 known breast cancer susceptibility loci were also
      associated with risk of TN breast cancer (P < 0.05). Associations with TN breast 
      cancer were confirmed for 10 loci (LGR6, MDM4, CASP8, 2q35, 2p24.1,
      TERT-rs10069690, ESR1, TOX3, 19p13.1, RALY), and we identified associations with 
      TN breast cancer for 15 additional breast cancer loci (P < 0.05: PEX14, 2q24.1,
      2q31.1, ADAM29, EBF1, TCF7L2, 11q13.1, 11q24.3, 12p13.1, PTHLH, NTN4, 12q24,
      BRCA2, RAD51L1-rs2588809, MKL1). Further, two SNPs independent of previously
      reported signals in ESR1 [rs12525163 odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, P = 4.9 x 10(-) (4)]
      and 19p13.1 (rs1864112 OR = 0.84, P = 1.8 x 10(-) (9)) were associated with TN
      breast cancer. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for TN breast cancer based on known
      breast cancer risk variants showed a 4-fold difference in risk between the
      highest and lowest PRS quintiles (OR = 4.03, 95% confidence interval 3.46-4.70, P
      = 4.8 x 10(-) (69)). This translates to an absolute risk for TN breast cancer
      ranging from 0.8% to 3.4%, suggesting that genetic variation may be used for TN
      breast cancer risk prediction.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. By now,
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci associated
      with the risk of developing lung cancer. However, these loci account for only a
      small fraction of the familial lung cancer risk. We hypothesized that epistasis
      may contribute to the missing heritability. To test this hypothesis, we
      systematically evaluated the association of epistasis of genetic variants with
      risk of lung cancer in Han Chinese cohorts. We conducted a pairwise genetic
      interaction analysis of 591370 variants, using BOolean Operation-based Screening 
      and Testing (BOOST), in an ongoing GWAS of lung cancer that includes 2331 cases
      and 3077 controls. Pairs of epistatic loci with P BOOST </= 1.00x10(-6) were
      further evaluated by a logistic regression model (LRM) with covariate adjustment.
      Four promising epistatic pairs identified at the screening stage (P LRM </=
      2.86x10(-) (13)) were validated in two replication cohorts: the first from
      Beijing (1534 cases and 1489 controls) and the second from Shenyang and Guangzhou
      (2512 cases and 2449 controls). Using this combined analysis, we identified an
      interaction between rs2562796 and rs16832404 at 2p32.2 that was significantly
      associated with the risk of developing lung cancer (P LRM = 1.03x10(-13) in total
      13 392 subjects). This study is the first investigation of epistasis for lung
      cancer on a genome-wide scale in Han Chinese. It addresses part of the missing
      heritability in lung cancer risk and provides novel insight into the
      multifactorial etiology of lung cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci associated with bladder
      cancer risk.
PG  - 1387-98
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddt519 [doi]
AB  - Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 11
      independent susceptibility loci associated with bladder cancer risk. To discover 
      additional risk variants, we conducted a new GWAS of 2422 bladder cancer cases
      and 5751 controls, followed by a meta-analysis with two independently published
      bladder cancer GWAS, resulting in a combined analysis of 6911 cases and 11 814
      controls of European descent. TaqMan genotyping of 13 promising single nucleotide
      polymorphisms with P < 1 x 10(-5) was pursued in a follow-up set of 801 cases and
      1307 controls. Two new loci achieved genome-wide statistical significance:
      rs10936599 on 3q26.2 (P = 4.53 x 10(-9)) and rs907611 on 11p15.5 (P = 4.11 x
      10(-8)). Two notable loci were also identified that approached genome-wide
      statistical significance: rs6104690 on 20p12.2 (P = 7.13 x 10(-7)) and rs4510656 
      on 6p22.3 (P = 6.98 x 10(-7)); these require further studies for confirmation. In
      conclusion, our study has identified new susceptibility alleles for bladder
      cancer risk that require fine-mapping and laboratory investigation, which could
      further understanding into the biological underpinnings of bladder
      carcinogenesis.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in worldwide including
      Japan. Several studies have identified common genetic variants to be associated
      with the risk of breast cancer. Due to the complex linkage disequilibrium
      structure and various environmental exposures in different populations, it is
      essential to identify variants associated with breast cancer in each population, 
      which subsequently facilitate the better understanding of mammary carcinogenesis.
      In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) as well as
      whole-genome imputation with 2,642 cases and 2,099 unaffected female controls. We
      further examined 13 suggestive loci (P<1.0 x 10(-5)) using an independent sample 
      set of 2,885 cases and 3,395 controls and successfully validated two
      previously-reported loci, rs2981578 (combined P-value of 1.31 x 10(-12), OR =
      1.23; 95% CI = 1.16-.30) on chromosome 10q26 (FGFR2), rs3803662 (combined P-value
      of 2.79 x 10(-11), OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.15-.28) and rs12922061 (combined P-value
      of 3.97 x 10(-10), OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.15-.31) on chromosome 16q12
      (TOX3-LOC643714). Weighted genetic risk score on the basis of three significantly
      associated variants and two previously reported breast cancer associated loci in 
      East Asian population revealed that individuals who carry the most risk alleles
      in category 5 have 2.2 times higher risk of developing breast cancer in the
      Japanese population than those who carry the least risk alleles in reference
      category 1. Although we could not identify additional loci associated with breast
      cancer, our study utilized one of the largest sample sizes reported to date, and 
      provided genetic status that represent the Japanese population. Further local and
      international collaborative study is essential to identify additional genetic
      variants that could lead to a better, accurate prediction for breast cancer.

AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC), a neoplasm of the uterine epithelial lining, is the most
      common gynecological malignancy in developed countries and the fourth most common
      cancer among US women. Women with a family history of EC have an increased risk
      for the disease, suggesting that inherited genetic factors play a role. We
      conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of Type I EC. Stage 1
      included 5,472 women (2,695 cases and 2,777 controls) of European ancestry from
      seven studies. We selected independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      that displayed the most significant associations with EC in Stage 1 for
      replication among 17,948 women (4,382 cases and 13,566 controls) in a multiethnic
      population (African America, Asian, Latina, Hawaiian and European ancestry), from
      nine studies. Although no novel variants reached genome-wide significance, we
      replicated previously identified associations with genetic markers near the HNF1B
      locus. Our findings suggest that larger studies with specific tumor
      classification are necessary to identify novel genetic polymorphisms associated
      with EC susceptibility.

      risk: a genome-wide interaction study.

LID - 10.1530/ERC-13-0349 [doi]
AB  - Women using menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) are at increased risk of developing 
      breast cancer (BC). To detect genetic modifiers of the association between
      current use of MHT and BC risk, we conducted a meta-analysis of four genome-wide 
      case-only studies followed by replication in 11 case-control studies. We used a
      case-only design to assess interactions between single-nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs) and current MHT use on risk of overall and lobular BC. The discovery stage
      included 2920 cases (541 lobular) from four genome-wide association studies. The 
      top 1391 SNPs showing P values for interaction (Pint) <3.0 x 10(-3) were selected
      for replication using pooled case-control data from 11 studies of the Breast
      Cancer Association Consortium, including 7689 cases (676 lobular) and 9266
      controls. Fixed-effects meta-analysis was used to derive combined Pint. No SNP
      reached genome-wide significance in either the discovery or combined stage. We
      observed effect modification of current MHT use on overall BC risk by two SNPs on
      chr13 near POMP (combined Pint</=8.9 x 10(-6)), two SNPs in SLC25A21 (combined
      Pint</=4.8 x 10(-5)), and three SNPs in PLCG2 (combined Pint</=4.5 x 10(-5)). The
      association between lobular BC risk was potentially modified by one SNP in TMEFF2
      (combined Pint</=2.7 x 10(-5)), one SNP in CD80 (combined Pint</=8.2 x 10(-6)),
      three SNPs on chr17 near TMEM132E (combined Pint</=2.2x10(-6)), and two SNPs on
      chr18 near SLC25A52 (combined Pint</=4.6 x 10(-5)). In conclusion, polymorphisms 
      in genes related to solute transportation in mitochondria, transmembrane
      signaling, and immune cell activation are potentially modifying BC risk
      associated with current use of MHT. These findings warrant replication in
      independent studies.

      patients.
PG  - R81
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is one of the most common adverse
      events caused by conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, yet there has been very
      little progress in the prevention or treatment of this side effect. Although this
      is not a life-threatening event, alopecia is very psychologically difficult for
      many women to manage. In order to improve the quality of life for these women, it
      is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced
      alopecia and develop ways to effectively prevent and/or treat it. To identify the
      genetic risk factors associated with chemotherapy-induced alopecia, we conducted 
      a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using DNA samples from breast cancer
      patients who were treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: We performed a case-control
      association study of 303 individuals who developed grade 2 alopecia, and compared
      them with 880 breast cancer patients who did not show hair loss after being
      treated with conventional chemotherapy. In addition, we separately analyzed a
      subset of patients who received specific combination therapies by GWASs and
      applied the weighted genetic risk scoring (wGRS) system to investigate the
      cumulative effects of the associated SNPs. RESULTS: We identified an SNP
      significantly associated with drug-induced grade 2 alopecia (rs3820706 in CACNB4 
      (calcium channel voltage-dependent subunit beta 4) on 2q23, P = 8.13 x 10(-9), OR
      = 3.71) and detected several SNPs that showed some suggestive associations by
      subgroup analyses. We also classified patients into four groups on the basis of
      wGRS analysis and found that patients who classified in the highest risk group
      showed 443 times higher risk of antimicrotubule agents-induced alopecia than the 
      lowest risk group. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests several associated genes and
      should shed some light on the molecular mechanism of alopecia in
      chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients and hopefully will contribute to
      development of interventions that will improve the quality of life (QOL) of
      cancer patients.

AB  - CONTEXT: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of differentiated thyroid cancer
      (DTC) have identified associations with polymorphisms at 2q35 (DIRC3), 8p12
      (NRG1), 9q22.33 (FOXE1), and 14q13.2 (NKX2-1). However, most of the inherited
      genetic risk factors of DTC remain to be discovered. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was
      to identify additional common DTC susceptibility loci. DESIGN: We conducted a
      GWAS in a high-incidence Italian population of 690 cases and 497 controls and
      followed up the most significant polymorphisms in 2 additional Italian series and
      in 3 low-incidence populations totaling 2958 cases and 3727 controls. RESULTS:
      After excluding the most robust previously identified locus (9q22.33), the
      strongest association was shown by rs6759952, confirming the recently published
      association in DIRC3 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21, P = 6.4 x 10(-10), GWAS and all
      replications combined). Additionally, in the combined analysis of the Italian
      series, suggestive associations were attained with rs10238549 and rs7800391 in
      IMMP2L (OR = 1.27, P = 4.1 x 10(-6); and OR = 1.25, P = 5.7 x 10(-6)), rs7617304 
      in RARRES1 (OR = 1.25, P = 4.6 x 10(-5)) and rs10781500 in SNAPC4/CARD9 (OR =
      1.23, P = 3.5 x 10(-5)). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide additional insights
      into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to DTC.
      Additional studies are needed to determine the role of the identified
      polymorphisms in the development of DTC and their possible use in the clinical
      practice.

AB  - To identify new genetic risk factors for cervical cancer, we conducted a
      genome-wide association study in the Han Chinese population. The initial
      discovery set included 1,364 individuals with cervical cancer (cases) and 3,028
      female controls, and we selected a 'stringently matched samples' subset (829
      cases and 990 controls) from the discovery set on the basis of principal
      component analysis; the follow-up stages included two independent sample sets
      (1,824 cases and 3,808 controls for follow-up 1 and 2,343 cases and 3,388
      controls for follow-up 2). We identified strong evidence of associations between 
      cervical cancer and two new loci: 4q12 (rs13117307, Pcombined, stringently
      matched=9.69x10(-9), per-allele odds ratio (OR)stringently matched=1.26) and
      17q12 (rs8067378, Pcombined, stringently matched=2.00x10(-8), per-allele
      ORstringently matched=1.18). We additionally replicated an association between
      HLA-DPB1 and HLA-DPB2 (HLA-DPB1/2) at 6p21.32 and cervical cancer (rs4282438,
      Pcombined, stringently matched=4.52x10(-27), per-allele ORstringently
      matched=0.75). Our findings provide new insights into the genetic etiology of
      cervical cancer.

AB  - We conducted a genome-wide scan of SNPs to identify variants associated with
      length of survival in 1,331 individuals with esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma
      (ESCC), with associations validated in 2 independent sets including 1,962
      individuals with this cancer. We identified rs1050631 in SLC39A6 as associated
      with the survival times of affected individuals, with the hazard ratio for death 
      from ESCC in the combined sample being 1.30 (95% confidence interval (CI) =
      1.19-1.43; P = 3.77 x 10(-8)). rs7242481, located in the 5' UTR of SLC39A6,
      disturbs a transcriptional repressor binding site and results in upregulation of 
      SLC39A6 expression. Immunohistochemical staining of ESCC tissues showed that
      higher expression of SLC39A6 protein was correlated with shorter length of
      survival in individuals with advanced ESCC (P = 0.013). Knockdown of SLC39A6
      expression suppressed proliferation and invasion in ESCC cells. These results
      suggest that SLC39A6 has an important role in the prognosis of ESCC and may be a 
      potential therapeutic target.

LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddt142 [doi]
AB  - Aiming to identify novel genetic loci for pigmentation and skin cancer, we
      conducted a series of genome-wide association studies on hair color, eye color,
      number of sunburns, tanning ability and number of non-melanoma skin cancers
      (NMSCs) among 10 183 European Americans in the discovery stage and 4504 European 
      Americans in the replication stage (for eye color, 3871 males in the discovery
      stage and 2496 males in the replication stage). We targeted novel chromosome
      regions besides the known ones for replication. As a result, we identified a new 
      region downstream of the EDNRB gene on 13q22 associated with hair color and the
      strongest association was the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs975739 (P = 
      2.4 x 10(-14); P = 5.4 x 10(-9) in the discovery set and P = 1.2 x 10(-6) in the 
      replication set). Using blue, intermediate (including green) and brown eye colors
      as co-dominant outcomes, we identified the SNP rs3002288 in VASH2 on 1q32.3
      associated with brown eye (P = 7.0 x 10(-8); P = 5.3 x 10(-5) in the discovery
      set and P = 0.02 in the replication set). Additionally, we identified a
      significant interaction between the SNPs rs7173419 and rs12913832 in the OCA2
      gene region on brown eye color (P-value for interaction = 3.8 x 10(-3)). As for
      the number of NMSCs, we identified two independent SNPs on chr6 and one SNP on
      chromosome 14: rs12203592 in IRF4 (P = 7.2 x 10(-14); P = 1.8 x 10(-8) in the
      discovery set and P = 6.7 x 10(-7) in the replication set), rs12202284 between

AB  - BRCA1-associated breast and ovarian cancer risks can be modified by common
      genetic variants. To identify further cancer risk-modifying loci, we performed a 
      multi-stage GWAS of 11,705 BRCA1 carriers (of whom 5,920 were diagnosed with
      breast and 1,839 were diagnosed with ovarian cancer), with a further replication 
      in an additional sample of 2,646 BRCA1 carriers. We identified a novel breast
      cancer risk modifier locus at 1q32 for BRCA1 carriers (rs2290854, P = 2.7 x
      10(-8), HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.09-1.20). In addition, we identified two novel
      ovarian cancer risk modifier loci: 17q21.31 (rs17631303, P = 1.4 x 10(-8), HR =
      1.27, 95% CI: 1.17-1.38) and 4q32.3 (rs4691139, P = 3.4 x 10(-8), HR = 1.20, 95% 
      CI: 1.17-1.38). The 4q32.3 locus was not associated with ovarian cancer risk in
      the general population or BRCA2 carriers, suggesting a BRCA1-specific
      association. The 17q21.31 locus was also associated with ovarian cancer risk in
      8,211 BRCA2 carriers (P = 2x10(-4)). These loci may lead to an improved
      understanding of the etiology of breast and ovarian tumors in BRCA1 carriers.
      Based on the joint distribution of the known BRCA1 breast cancer risk-modifying
      loci, we estimated that the breast cancer lifetime risks for the 5% of BRCA1
      carriers at lowest risk are 28%-50% compared to 81%-100% for the 5% at highest
      risk. Similarly, based on the known ovarian cancer risk-modifying loci, the 5% of
      BRCA1 carriers at lowest risk have an estimated lifetime risk of developing
      ovarian cancer of 28% or lower, whereas the 5% at highest risk will have a risk
      of 63% or higher. Such differences in risk may have important implications for
      risk prediction and clinical management for BRCA1 carriers.

AB  - Common genetic variants contribute to the observed variation in breast cancer
      risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers; those known to date have all been found through
      population-based genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To comprehensively
      identify breast cancer risk modifying loci for BRCA2 mutation carriers, we
      conducted a deep replication of an ongoing GWAS discovery study. Using the ranked
      P-values of the breast cancer associations with the imputed genotype of 1.4 M
      SNPs, 19,029 SNPs were selected and designed for inclusion on a custom Illumina
      array that included a total of 211,155 SNPs as part of a multi-consortial
      project. DNA samples from 3,881 breast cancer affected and 4,330 unaffected BRCA2
      mutation carriers from 47 studies belonging to the Consortium of Investigators of
      Modifiers of BRCA1/2 were genotyped and available for analysis. We replicated
      previously reported breast cancer susceptibility alleles in these BRCA2 mutation 
      carriers and for several regions (including FGFR2, MAP3K1, CDKN2A/B, and PTHLH)
      identified SNPs that have stronger evidence of association than those previously 
      published. We also identified a novel susceptibility allele at 6p24 that was
      inversely associated with risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers (rs9348512; per allele 
      HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90, P = 3.9 x 10(-8)). This SNP was not associated with 
      breast cancer risk either in the general population or in BRCA1 mutation
      carriers. The locus lies within a region containing TFAP2A, which encodes a
      transcriptional activation protein that interacts with several tumor suppressor
      genes. This report identifies the first breast cancer risk locus specific to a
      BRCA2 mutation background. This comprehensive update of novel and previously
      reported breast cancer susceptibility loci contributes to the establishment of a 
      panel of SNPs that modify breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers. This
      panel may have clinical utility for women with BRCA2 mutations weighing options
      for medical prevention of breast cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide association studies identify four ER negative-specific breast cancer 
      risk loci.
PG  - 392-8, 398e1-2

AB  - Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors represent 20-30% of all breast cancers,
      with a higher proportion occurring in younger women and women of African
      ancestry. The etiology and clinical behavior of ER-negative tumors are different 
      from those of tumors expressing ER (ER positive), including differences in
      genetic predisposition. To identify susceptibility loci specific to ER-negative
      disease, we combined in a meta-analysis 3 genome-wide association studies of
      4,193 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 35,194 controls with a series of 40
      follow-up studies (6,514 cases and 41,455 controls), genotyped using a custom
      Illumina array, iCOGS, developed by the Collaborative Oncological
      Gene-environment Study (COGS). SNPs at four loci, 1q32.1 (MDM4, P = 2.1 x 10(-12)
      and LGR6, P = 1.4 x 10(-8)), 2p24.1 (P = 4.6 x 10(-8)) and 16q12.2 (FTO, P = 4.0 
      x 10(-8)), were associated with ER-negative but not ER-positive breast cancer (P 
      > 0.05). These findings provide further evidence for distinct etiological
      pathways associated with invasive ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers.

TI  - Identification of 23 new prostate cancer susceptibility loci using the iCOGS
      custom genotyping array.
PG  - 385-91, 391e1-2
LID - 10.1038/ng.2560 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in males in developed
      countries. To identify common prostate cancer susceptibility alleles, we
      genotyped 211,155 SNPs on a custom Illumina array (iCOGS) in blood DNA from
      25,074 prostate cancer cases and 24,272 controls from the international PRACTICAL
      Consortium. Twenty-three new prostate cancer susceptibility loci were identified 
      at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)). More than 70 prostate cancer
      susceptibility loci, explaining approximately 30% of the familial risk for this
      disease, have now been identified. On the basis of combined risks conferred by
      the new and previously known risk loci, the top 1% of the risk distribution has a
      4.7-fold higher risk than the average of the population being profiled. These
      results will facilitate population risk stratification for clinical studies.

TI  - GWAS meta-analysis and replication identifies three new susceptibility loci for
      ovarian cancer.
PG  - 362-70, 370e1-2

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified four susceptibility loci
      for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), with another two suggestive loci reaching
      near genome-wide significance. We pooled data from a GWAS conducted in North
      America with another GWAS from the UK. We selected the top 24,551 SNPs for
      inclusion on the iCOGS custom genotyping array. We performed follow-up genotyping
      in 18,174 individuals with EOC (cases) and 26,134 controls from 43 studies from
      the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. We validated the two loci at 3q25 and 
      17q21 that were previously found to have associations close to genome-wide
      significance and identified three loci newly associated with risk: two loci
      associated with all EOC subtypes at 8q21 (rs11782652, P = 5.5 x 10(-9)) and 10p12
      (rs1243180, P = 1.8 x 10(-8)) and another locus specific to the serous subtype at
      17q12 (rs757210, P = 8.1 x 10(-10)). An integrated molecular analysis of genes
      and regulatory regions at these loci provided evidence for functional mechanisms 
      underlying susceptibility and implicated CHMP4C in the pathogenesis of ovarian
      cancer.

TI  - Large-scale genotyping identifies 41 new loci associated with breast cancer risk.
PG  - 353-61, 361e1-2
LID - 10.1038/ng.2563 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. Common variants at 27 loci
      have been identified as associated with susceptibility to breast cancer, and
      these account for approximately 9% of the familial risk of the disease. We report
      here a meta-analysis of 9 genome-wide association studies, including 10,052
      breast cancer cases and 12,575 controls of European ancestry, from which we
      selected 29,807 SNPs for further genotyping. These SNPs were genotyped in 45,290 
      cases and 41,880 controls of European ancestry from 41 studies in the Breast
      Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The SNPs were genotyped as part of a
      collaborative genotyping experiment involving four consortia (Collaborative
      Oncological Gene-environment Study, COGS) and used a custom Illumina iSelect
      genotyping array, iCOGS, comprising more than 200,000 SNPs. We identified SNPs at
      41 new breast cancer susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x
      10(-8)). Further analyses suggest that more than 1,000 additional loci are
      involved in breast cancer susceptibility.

PG  - 657-70
LID - 10.1210/me.2012-1397 [doi]
AB  - We performed a discovery genome-wide association study to identify genetic
      factors associated with variation in plasma estradiol (E2) concentrations using
      DNA from 772 postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast
      cancer prior to the initiation of aromatase inhibitor therapy. Association
      analyses showed that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (rs1864729) with
      the lowest P value (P = 3.49E-08), mapped to chromosome 8 near TSPYL5. We also
      identified 17 imputed SNPs in or near TSPYL5 with P values < 5E-08, one of which,
      rs2583506, created a functional estrogen response element. We then used a panel
      of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) stably transfected with ERalpha with known
      genome-wide SNP genotypes to demonstrate that TSPYL5 expression increased after
      E2 exposure of cells heterozygous for variant TSPYL5 SNP genotypes, but not in
      those homozygous for wild-type alleles. TSPYL5 knockdown decreased, and
      overexpression increased aromatase (CYP19A1) expression in MCF-7 cells, LCLs, and
      adipocytes through the skin/adipose (I.4) promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
      assay showed that TSPYL5 bound to the CYP19A1 I.4 promoter. A putative TSPYL5
      binding motif was identified in 43 genes, and TSPYL5 appeared to function as a
      transcription factor for most of those genes. In summary, genome-wide significant
      SNPs in TSPYL5 were associated with elevated plasma E2 in postmenopausal breast
      cancer patients. SNP rs2583506 created a functional estrogen response element,
      and LCLs with variant SNP genotypes displayed increased E2-dependent TSPYL5
      expression. TSPYL5 induced CYP19A1 expression and that of many other genes. These
      studies have revealed a novel mechanism for regulating aromatase expression and
      plasma E2 concentrations in postmenopausal women with ER(+) breast cancer.

PG  - 624-33
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djt051 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical carcinoma has a heritable genetic component, but the genetic
      basis of cervical cancer is still not well understood. METHODS: We performed a
      genome-wide association study of 731 422 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      in 1075 cervical cancer case subjects and 4014 control subjects and replicated it
      in 1140 case subjects and 1058 control subjects. The association between top SNPs
      and cervical cancer was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) with unconditional logistic regression. All statistical tests
      were two-sided. RESULTS: Three independent loci in the major histocompatibility
      complex (MHC) region at 6p21.3 were associated with cervical cancer: the first is
      adjacent to the MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A gene (MICA)
      (rs2516448; OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.31 to 1.54; P = 1.6x10(-18)); the second is
      between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 (rs9272143; OR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.62 to 0.72; P =
      9.3x10(-24)); and the third is at HLA-DPB2 (rs3117027; OR=1.25, 95% CI = 1.15 to 
      1.35; P = 4.9x10(-8)). We also confirmed previously reported associations of
      B*0702 and DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602 with susceptibility to and
      DRB1*1301-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0603 with protection against cervical cancer. The three 
      new loci are statistically independent of these specific human leukocyte antigen 
      alleles/haplotypes. MICA encodes a membrane-bound protein that acts as a ligand
      for NKG2D to activate antitumor effects. The risk allele of rs2516448 is in
      perfect linkage disequilibrium with a frameshift mutation (A5.1) of MICA, which
      results in a truncated protein. Functional analysis shows that women carrying
      this mutation have lower levels of membrane-bound MICA. CONCLUSIONS: Three novel 
      loci in the MHC may affect susceptibility to cervical cancer in situ, including
      the MICA-A5.1 allele that may cause impaired immune activation and increased risk
      of tumor development.

AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) influencing overall survival (OS) of small-cell lung cancer 
      (SCLC) patients. We prospectively collected blood samples from 139 SCLC patients 
      who participated in phase II studies of irinotecan and cisplatin (IP)
      chemotherapy as first-line therapy. Among 334 127 SNPs, which passed quality
      control, seven showed significant association with OS. The rs16950650CT,
      rs7186128AG or GG, rs17574269AG, rs8020368CC, rs4655567CC, rs2166219TT or
      rs2018683TT showed shorter OS compared with control alleles. Among the seven
      SNPs, rs4655567, rs8020368 and rs2018683 were significantly associated with a
      resistant relapse (RR). In the multivariate analysis, rs8020368CC was
      significantly associated with higher risk of RR (odds ratio=16.7, P=0.007). In
      vitro and in silico analysis showed that SNPs in C14orf49 might be associated
      with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This exploratory GWAS identified
      candidate SNPs that may be predictive of the clinical outcome of SCLC patients
      receiving IP.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) simultaneously investigating hundreds of
      thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) have become a powerful tool in
      the investigation of new disease susceptibility loci. Haplotypes are sometimes
      thought to be superior to SNPs and are promising in genetic association analyses.
      The application of genome-wide haplotype analysis, however, is hindered by the
      complexity of haplotypes themselves and sophistication in computation. We
      systematically analyzed the haplotype effects for breast cancer risk among 5,761 
      African American women (3,016 cases and 2,745 controls) using a sliding window
      approach on the genome-wide scale. Three regions on chromosomes 1, 4 and 18
      exhibited moderate haplotype effects. Furthermore, among 21 breast cancer
      susceptibility loci previously established in European populations, 10p15 and
      14q24 are likely to harbor novel haplotype effects. We also proposed a heuristic 
      of determining the significance level and the effective number of independent
      tests by the permutation analysis on chromosome 22 data. It suggests that the
      effective number was approximately half of the total (7,794 out of 15,645), thus 
      the half number could serve as a quick reference to evaluating genome-wide
      significance if a similar sliding window approach of haplotype analysis is
      adopted in similar populations using similar genotype density.

AB  - PURPOSE: We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with change in 
      the AUA Symptom Score after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 723 patients treated with brachytherapy with or without
      external beam radiation therapy were assessed at baseline and annually after
      radiotherapy using the AUA Symptom Score. A 2-stage genome-wide association study
      was performed with the primary end point of change in AUA Symptom Score from
      baseline at each of 4 followup periods. Single nucleotide polymorphism
      associations were assessed using multivariable linear regression adjusting for
      pre-radiotherapy AUA Symptom Score severity category and clinical variables.
      Fisher's trend method was used to calculate combined p values from the discovery 
      and replication cohorts. RESULTS: A region on chromosome 9p21.2 containing 8
      single nucleotide polymorphisms showed the strongest association with change in
      AUA Symptom Score (combined p values 8.8x10(-6) to 6.5x10(-7) at 2 to 3 years
      after radiotherapy). These single nucleotide polymorphisms form a haplotype block
      that encompasses the inflammation signaling gene IFNK. These single nucleotide
      polymorphisms were independently associated with change in AUA Symptom Score
      after adjusting for clinical predictors including smoking history, hypertension, 
      alpha-blocker use and pre-radiotherapy AUA Symptom Score. An additional 24 single
      nucleotide polymorphisms showed moderate significance for association with change
      in AUA Symptom Score. Several of these single nucleotide polymorphisms were more 
      strongly associated with change in specific AUA Symptom Score items, including
      rs13035033 in the MYO3B gene, which was associated with straining (beta
      coefficient 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.2, p = 5.0x10(-9)). CONCLUSIONS: If validated,
      these single nucleotide polymorphisms could provide insight into the biology
      underlying urinary symptoms following radiotherapy and could lead to development 
      of an assay to identify patients at risk for experiencing these effects.

TI  - Genetic variants associated with breast cancer risk for Ashkenazi Jewish women
      with strong family histories but no identifiable BRCA1/2 mutation.
PG  - 523-36
LID - 10.1007/s00439-013-1269-4 [doi]
AB  - The ability to establish genetic risk models is critical for early identification
      and optimal treatment of breast cancer. For such a model to gain clinical
      utility, more variants must be identified beyond those discovered in previous
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This is especially true for women at high
      risk because of family history, but without BRCA1/2 mutations. This study
      incorporates three datasets in a GWAS analysis of women with Ashkenazi Jewish
      (AJ) homogeneous ancestry. Two independent discovery cohorts comprised 239 and
      238 AJ women with invasive breast cancer or preinvasive ductal carcinoma in situ 
      and strong family histories of breast cancer, but lacking the three BRCA1/2
      founder mutations, along with 294 and 230 AJ controls, respectively. An
      independent, third cohort of 203 AJ cases with familial breast cancer history and
      263 healthy controls of AJ women was used for validation. A total of 19 SNPs were
      identified as associated with familial breast cancer risk in AJ women. Among
      these SNPs, 13 were identified from a panel of 109 discovery SNPs, including an
      FGFR2 haplotype. In addition, six previously identified breast cancer GWAS SNPs
      were confirmed in this population. Seven of the 19 markers were significant in a 
      multivariate predictive model of familial breast cancer in AJ women, three novel 
      SNPs [rs17663555(5q13.2), rs566164(6q21), and rs11075884(16q22.2)], the FGFR2
      haplotype, and three previously published SNPs [rs13387042(2q35),
      rs2046210(ESR1), and rs3112612(TOX3)], yielding moderate predictive power with an
      area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC (receiver-operator characteristic curve) of
      0.74. Population-specific genetic variants in addition to variants shared with
      populations of European ancestry may improve breast cancer risk prediction among 
      AJ women from high-risk families without founder BRCA1/2 mutations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease of complex aetiology, with much 
      of the expected inherited risk being due to several common low risk variants.
      Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have identified 20 CRC risk variants.
      Nevertheless, these have only been able to explain part of the missing
      heritability. Moreover, these signals have only been inspected in populations of 
      Northern European origin. RESULTS: Thus, we followed the same approach in a
      Spanish cohort of 881 cases and 667 controls. Sixty-four variants at 24 loci were
      found to be associated with CRC at p-values <10-5. We therefore evaluated the 24 
      loci in another Spanish replication cohort (1481 cases and 1850 controls). Two of
      these SNPs, rs12080929 at 1p33 (Preplication=0.042; Ppooled=5.523x10-03; OR
      (CI95%)=0.866(0.782-0.959)) and rs11987193 at 8p12 (Preplication=0.039;
      Ppooled=6.985x10-5; OR (CI95%)=0.786(0.705-0.878)) were replicated in the second 
      Phase, although they did not reach genome-wide statistical significance.
      CONCLUSIONS: We have performed the first CRC GWAS in a Southern European
      population and by these means we were able to identify two new susceptibility
      variants at 1p33 and 8p12 loci. These two SNPs are located near the SLC5A9 and
      DUSP4 loci, respectively, which could be good functional candidates for the
      association signals. We therefore believe that these two markers constitute good 
      candidates for CRC susceptibility loci and should be further evaluated in other
      larger datasets. Moreover, we highlight that were these two SNPs true
      susceptibility variants, they would constitute a decrease in the CRC missing
      heritability fraction.

AB  - Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have begun to investigate associations
      between inherited genetic variations and breast cancer prognosis. Here, we report
      our findings from a GWAS conducted in 536 patients with early-onset breast cancer
      aged 40 or less at diagnosis and with a mean follow-up period of 4.1 years (SD = 
      1.96). Patients were selected from the Prospective Study of Outcomes in Sporadic 
      versus Hereditary breast cancer. A Bonferroni correction for multiple testing
      determined that a P value of 1.0 x 10(-7) was a statistically significant
      association signal. Following quality control, we identified 487,496 single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for association tests in stage 1. In stage 2, 35
      SNPs with the most significant associations were genotyped in 1,516 independent
      cases from the same early-onset cohort. In stage 2, 11 SNPs remained associated
      in the same direction (P </= 0.05). Fixed effects meta-analysis models identified
      one SNP associated at close to genome wide level of significance 556 kb upstream 
      of the ARRDC3 locus [HR = 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.33-1.96; P = 9.5 
      x 10(-7)]. Four further associations at or close to the PBX1, RORalpha, NTN1, and
      SYT6 loci also came close to genome-wide significance levels (P = 10(-6)). In the
      first ever GWAS for the identification of SNPs associated with prognosis in
      patients with early-onset breast cancer, we report a SNP upstream of the ARRDC3
      locus as potentially associated with prognosis (median follow-up time for
      genotypes: CC = 4 years, CT = 3 years, and TT = 2.7 years; Wilcoxon rank-sum test
      CC vs. CT, P = 4 x 10(-4) and CT vs. TT, P = 0.76). Four further loci may also be
      associated with prognosis.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified a number of
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with colorectal cancer (CRC)
      risk. However, these susceptibility loci known today explain only a small
      fraction of the genetic risk. Gene-gene interaction (GxG) is considered to be one
      source of the missing heritability. To address this, we performed a genome-wide
      search for pair-wise GxG associated with CRC risk using 8,380 cases and 10,558
      controls in the discovery phase and 2,527 cases and 2,658 controls in the
      replication phase. We developed a simple, but powerful method for testing
      interaction, which we term the Average Risk Due to Interaction (ARDI). With this 
      method, we conducted a genome-wide search to identify SNPs showing evidence for
      GxG with previously identified CRC susceptibility loci from 14 independent
      regions. We also conducted a genome-wide search for GxG using the marginal
      association screening and examining interaction among SNPs that pass the
      screening threshold (p<10(-4)). For the known locus rs10795668 (10p14), we found 
      an interacting SNP rs367615 (5q21) with replication p = 0.01 and combined p =
      4.19x10(-8). Among the top marginal SNPs after LD pruning (n = 163), we
      identified an interaction between rs1571218 (20p12.3) and rs10879357 (12q21.1)
      (nominal combined p = 2.51x10(-6); Bonferroni adjusted p = 0.03). Our study
      represents the first comprehensive search for GxG in CRC, and our results may
      provide new insight into the genetic etiology of CRC.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Heritable factors contribute to the development of colorectal 
      cancer. Identifying the genetic loci associated with colorectal tumor formation
      could elucidate the mechanisms of pathogenesis. METHODS: We conducted a
      genome-wide association study that included 14 studies, 12,696 cases of
      colorectal tumors (11,870 cancer, 826 adenoma), and 15,113 controls of European
      descent. The 10 most statistically significant, previously unreported findings
      were followed up in 6 studies; these included 3056 colorectal tumor cases (2098
      cancer, 958 adenoma) and 6658 controls of European and Asian descent. RESULTS:
      Based on the combined analysis, we identified a locus that reached the
      conventional genome-wide significance level at less than 5.0 x 10(-8): an
      intergenic region on chromosome 2q32.3, close to nucleic acid binding protein 1
      (most significant single nucleotide polymorphism: rs11903757; odds ratio [OR],
      1.15 per risk allele; P = 3.7 x 10(-8)). We also found evidence for 3 additional 
      loci with P values less than 5.0 x 10(-7): a locus within the laminin gamma 1
      gene on chromosome 1q25.3 (rs10911251; OR, 1.10 per risk allele; P = 9.5 x
      10(-8)), a locus within the cyclin D2 gene on chromosome 12p13.32 (rs3217810 per 
      risk allele; OR, 0.84; P = 5.9 x 10(-8)), and a locus in the T-box 3 gene on
      chromosome 12q24.21 (rs59336; OR, 0.91 per risk allele; P = 3.7 x 10(-7)).
      CONCLUSIONS: In a large genome-wide association study, we associated
      polymorphisms close to nucleic acid binding protein 1 (which encodes a
      DNA-binding protein involved in DNA repair) with colorectal tumor risk. We also
      provided evidence for an association between colorectal tumor risk and
      polymorphisms in laminin gamma 1 (this is the second gene in the laminin family
      to be associated with colorectal cancers), cyclin D2 (which encodes for cyclin
      D2), and T-box 3 (which encodes a T-box transcription factor and is a target of
      Wnt signaling to beta-catenin). The roles of these genes and their products in
      cancer pathogenesis warrant further investigation.

AB  - To identify new genetic factors for colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted a
      genome-wide association study in east Asians. By analyzing genome-wide data in
      2,098 cases and 5,749 controls, we selected 64 promising SNPs for replication in 
      an independent set of samples, including up to 5,358 cases and 5,922 controls. We
      identified four SNPs with association P values of 8.58 x 10(-7) to 3.77 x 10(-10)
      in the combined analysis of all east Asian samples. Three of the four were
      replicated in a study conducted in 26,060 individuals of European descent, with
      combined P values of 1.22 x 10(-10) for rs647161 (5q31.1), 6.64 x 10(-9) for
      rs2423279 (20p12.3) and 3.06 x 10(-8) for rs10774214 (12p13.32 near the CCND2
      gene), derived from meta-analysis of data from both east Asian and
      European-ancestry populations. This study identified three new CRC susceptibility
      loci and provides additional insight into the genetics and biology of CRC.

PG  - 152-60
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303477 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is 
      limited and few prognostic factors are known. We conducted a two-stage
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify germline variants associated
      with survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS: We analysed
      overall survival in relation to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 1005
      patients from two large GWAS datasets, PanScan I and ChinaPC. Cox proportional
      hazards regression was used in an additive genetic model with adjustment for age,
      sex, clinical stage and the top four principal components of population
      stratification. The first stage included 642 cases of European ancestry
      (PanScan), from which the top SNPs (p</=10(-5)) were advanced to a joint analysis
      with 363 additional patients from China (ChinaPC). RESULTS: In the first stage of
      cases of European descent, the top-ranked loci were at chromosomes 11p15.4,
      18p11.21 and 1p36.13, tagged by rs12362504 (p=1.63x10(-7)), rs981621
      (p=1.65x10(-7)) and rs16861827 (p=3.75x10(-7)), respectively. 131 SNPs with
      p</=10(-5) were advanced to a joint analysis with cases from the ChinaPC study.
      In the joint analysis, the top-ranked SNP was rs10500715 (minor allele frequency,
      0.37; p=1.72x10(-7)) on chromosome 11p15.4, which is intronic to the SET binding 
      factor 2 (SBF2) gene. The HR (95% CI) for death was 0.74 (0.66 to 0.84) in
      PanScan I, 0.79 (0.65 to 0.97) in ChinaPC and 0.76 (0.68 to 0.84) in the joint
      analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Germline genetic variation in the SBF2 locus was
      associated with overall survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma of
      European and Asian ancestry. This association should be investigated in
      additional large patient cohorts.

AB  - The prognostic significance of inherited genetic variants in advanced-stage
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remains unknown. In this study, we
      genotyped 271 817 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 348 advanced NSCLC patients 
      who received chemotherapy and analyzed their association with prognosis by using 
      Cox proportional hazard regression model adjusted for known prognostic factors.
      Top candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected using the
      bootstrap re-sampling procedure. Median age of patient population was 56 years.
      Proportions of female, never smokers and adenocarcinoma were 64.9, 67.5 and
      80.4%, respectively. We identified 17 top candidate SNPs related to prognosis
      using cut-off minimum P value of <5.0 x 10(-5) in at least 70% of 1000 bootstrap 
      samples. These SNPs were located in the genomic regions of the FAM154A, ANKS1A,
      DLST, THSD7B, NCOA2, CDH8, SLC35D2, NALCN and EGF genes. The most significant
      SNP, rs1571228 (9p22.1:FAM154A), was significantly associated with overall
      survival in dominant model [AG+GG to AA, hazard ratio (HR) of death (95% CI) =
      0.53 (0.42-0.67); P = 2.025 x 10(-7)]. The SNP at 4q25:EGF, rs11098063, for which
      some genetic variations was previously reported to be associated with prognosis, 
      also showed significant association with overall survival in additive model [CC
      versus CT versus TT, HR (95% CI) = 1.00 versus 0.61 (0.47-0.78) versus 0.39
      (0.19-0.79); P = 9.582 x 10(-6)]. Survival differences according to the genotype 
      of these SNPs were independent of sex, smoking, histology and chemotherapy
      regimens. These results suggested the variants at multiple genetic loci might
      contribute to the risk of death in advanced NSCLC patients receiving
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Genome-wide association analysis identifies new lung cancer susceptibility loci
      in never-smoking women in Asia.
PG  - 1330-5

AB  - To identify common genetic variants that contribute to lung cancer
      susceptibility, we conducted a multistage genome-wide association study of lung
      cancer in Asian women who never smoked. We scanned 5,510 never-smoking female
      lung cancer cases and 4,544 controls drawn from 14 studies from mainland China,
      South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong. We genotyped the most
      promising variants (associated at P < 5 x 10(-6)) in an additional 1,099 cases
      and 2,913 controls. We identified three new susceptibility loci at 10q25.2
      (rs7086803, P = 3.54 x 10(-18)), 6q22.2 (rs9387478, P = 4.14 x 10(-10)) and
      6p21.32 (rs2395185, P = 9.51 x 10(-9)). We also confirmed associations reported
      for loci at 5p15.33 and 3q28 and a recently reported finding at 17q24.3. We
      observed no evidence of association for lung cancer at 15q25 in never-smoking
      women in Asia, providing strong evidence that this locus is not associated with
      lung cancer independent of smoking.

AB  - Suboptimal cellular DNA repair capacity (DRC) has been shown to be associated
      with enhanced cancer risk, but genetic variants affecting the DRC phenotype have 
      not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, with the available DRC
      phenotype data, we analyzed correlations between the DRC phenotype and genotypes 
      detected by the Illumina 317K platform in 1,774 individuals of European ancestry 
      from a Texas lung cancer genome-wide association study. The discovery phase was
      followed by a replication in an independent set of 1,374 cases and controls of
      European ancestry. We applied a generalized linear model with single nucleotide
      polymorphisms as predictors and DRC (a continuous variable) as the outcome.
      Covariates of age, sex, pack-years of smoking, DRC assay-related variables, and
      case-control status of the study participants were adjusted in the model. We
      validated that reduced DRC was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer
      in both independent datasets. Several suggestive loci that contributed to the DRC
      phenotype were defined in ERCC2/XPD, PHACTR2, and DUSP1. In summary, we
      determined that DRC is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, and we defined
      several genetic loci contributing to DRC phenotype.

AB  - In Western countries, prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer of men and one
      of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men. Several genome-wide
      association studies have yielded numerous common variants conferring risk of
      prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed 32.5 million variants discovered by
      whole-genome sequencing 1,795 Icelanders. We identified a new low-frequency
      variant at 8q24 associated with prostate cancer in European populations,
      rs188140481[A] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.90; P(combined) = 6.2 x 10(-34)), with an
      average risk allele frequency in controls of 0.54%. This variant is only very
      weakly correlated (r(2) </= 0.06) with previously reported risk variants at 8q24,
      and its association remains significant after adjustment for all known
      risk-associated variants. Carriers of rs188140481[A] were diagnosed with prostate
      cancer 1.26 years younger than non-carriers (P = 0.0059). We also report results 
      for a previously described HOXB13 variant (rs138213197[T]), confirming it as a
      prostate cancer risk variant in populations from across Europe.

AB  - Cancer susceptibility loci identified in reported genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS) are often tumor-specific; however, evidence of pleiotropy of some
      genes/loci has also been observed and biologically plausible. We hypothesized
      that there are important regions in the genome harboring genetic variants
      associated with risk of multiple types of cancer. In the current study, we
      attempted to map genetic variants that have consistent effects on risk of
      multiple cancers using our existing genome-wide scan data of lung cancer,
      noncardia gastric cancer, and esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma with overall
      5,368 cases and 4,006 controls (GWAS stage), followed by a further evaluation in 
      additional 9,001 cases with one of these cancer types and 11,436 controls
      (replication stage). Five variants satisfying the criteria of pleiotropy with p
      values from 1.10 x 10(-8) to 8.96 x 10(-6) for genome-wide scans of three cancer 
      types were further evaluated in the replication stage. We found consistent
      associations of rs2494938 at 6p21.1 and rs2285947 at 7p15.3 with these three
      cancers in both GWAS and replication stages. In combined samples of GWAS and
      replication stages, the minor alleles of rs2494938 and rs2285947 were
      significantly associated with an increased risk of the cancers (odds ratio [OR] =
      1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.19 and OR = 1.17, 95% CI, 1.12-1.21), 
      with the p values being 1.20 x 10(-12) and 1.26 x 10(-16), respectively, which
      are at a genome-wide significance level. Our findings highlight the potential
      importance of variants at 6p21.1 and 7p15.3 in the susceptibility to multiple
      cancers.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple common genetic
      variants associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PrCa), but these
      explain less than one-third of the heritability. To identify further
      susceptibility alleles, we conducted a meta-analysis of four GWAS including 5953 
      cases of aggressive PrCa and 11 463 controls (men without PrCa). We computed
      association tests for approximately 2.6 million SNPs and followed up the most
      significant SNPs by genotyping 49 121 samples in 29 studies through the
      international PRACTICAL and BPC3 consortia. We not only confirmed the association
      of a PrCa susceptibility locus, rs11672691 on chromosome 19, but also showed an
      association with aggressive PrCa [odds ratio = 1.12 (95% confidence interval
      1.03-1.21), P = 1.4 x 10(-8)]. This report describes a genetic variant which is
      associated with aggressive PrCa, which is a type of PrCa associated with a poorer
      prognosis.

AB  - Prostate cancer risk-associated variants have been reported in populations of
      European descent, African-Americans and Japanese using genome-wide association
      studies (GWAS). To systematically investigate prostate cancer risk-associated
      variants in Chinese men, we performed the first GWAS in Han Chinese. In addition 
      to confirming several associations reported in other ancestry groups, this study 
      identified two new risk-associated loci for prostate cancer on chromosomes 9q31.2
      (rs817826, P = 5.45 x 10(-14)) and 19q13.4 (rs103294, P = 5.34 x 10(-16)) in
      4,484 prostate cancer cases and 8,934 controls. The rs103294 marker at 19q13.4 is
      in strong linkage equilibrium with a 6.7-kb germline deletion that removes the
      first six of seven exons in LILRA3, a gene regulating inflammatory response, and 
      was significantly associated with the mRNA expression of LILRA3 in T cells (P < 1
      x 10(-4)). These findings may advance the understanding of genetic susceptibility
      to prostate cancer.

TI  - A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of breast cancer identifies
      two novel susceptibility loci at 6q14 and 20q11.
PG  - 5373-84
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds381 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of breast cancer defined by hormone
      receptor status have revealed loci contributing to susceptibility of estrogen
      receptor (ER)-negative subtypes. To identify additional genetic variants for
      ER-negative breast cancer, we conducted the largest meta-analysis of ER-negative 
      disease to date, comprising 4754 ER-negative cases and 31 663 controls from three
      GWAS: NCI Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3) (2188 ER-negative
      cases; 25 519 controls of European ancestry), Triple Negative Breast Cancer
      Consortium (TNBCC) (1562 triple negative cases; 3399 controls of European
      ancestry) and African American Breast Cancer Consortium (AABC) (1004 ER-negative 
      cases; 2745 controls). We performed in silico replication of 86 SNPs at P </= 1 x
      10(-5) in an additional 11 209 breast cancer cases (946 with ER-negative disease)
      and 16 057 controls of Japanese, Latino and European ancestry. We identified two 
      novel loci for breast cancer at 20q11 and 6q14. SNP rs2284378 at 20q11 was
      associated with ER-negative breast cancer (combined two-stage OR = 1.16; P = 1.1 
      x 10(-8)) but showed a weaker association with overall breast cancer (OR = 1.08, 
      P = 1.3 x 10(-6)) based on 17 869 cases and 43 745 controls and no association
      with ER-positive disease (OR = 1.01, P = 0.67) based on 9965 cases and 22 902
      controls. Similarly, rs17530068 at 6q14 was associated with breast cancer (OR =
      1.12; P = 1.1 x 10(-9)), and with both ER-positive (OR = 1.09; P = 1.5 x 10(-5)) 
      and ER-negative (OR = 1.16, P = 2.5 x 10(-7)) disease. We also confirmed three
      known loci associated with ER-negative (19p13) and both ER-negative and
      ER-positive breast cancer (6q25 and 12p11). Our results highlight the value of
      large-scale collaborative studies to identify novel breast cancer risk loci.

AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide
      gene-environment interaction analysis of esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma
      (ESCC) in 2,031 affected individuals (cases) and 2,044 controls with independent 
      validation in 8,092 cases and 8,620 controls. We identified nine new ESCC
      susceptibility loci, of which seven, at chromosomes 4q23, 16q12.1, 17q21, 22q12, 
      3q27, 17p13 and 18p11, had a significant marginal effect (P=1.78x10(-39) to
      P=2.49x10(-11)) and two of which, at 2q22 and 13q33, had a significant
      association only in the gene-alcohol drinking interaction (gene-environment
      interaction P (PGxE)=4.39x10(-11) and PGxE=4.80x10(-8), respectively). Variants
      at the 4q23 locus, which includes the ADH cluster, each had a significant
      interaction with alcohol drinking in their association with ESCC risk
      (PGxE=2.54x10(-7) to PGxE=3.23x10(-2)). We confirmed the known association of the
      ALDH2 locus on 12q24 to ESCC, and a joint analysis showed that drinkers with both
      of the ADH1B and ALDH2 risk alleles had a fourfold increased risk for ESCC
      compared to drinkers without these risk alleles. Our results underscore the
      direct genetic contribution to ESCC risk, as well as the genetic contribution to 
      ESCC through interaction with alcohol consumption.

TI  - A genome-wide association study identifies a genetic variant in the SIAH2 locus
      associated with hormonal receptor-positive breast cancer in Japanese.
PG  - 766-71
LID - 10.1038/jhg.2012.108 [doi]
AB  - In Japan, breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and the second
      leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. To identify genetic variants
      associated with the disease susceptibility, we performed a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) using a total of 1086 Japanese female patients with
      hormonal receptor-positive (HRP) breast cancer and 1816 female controls. We
      selected 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with suggestive associations
      in GWAS (P-value of <1 x 10(-4)) as well as 4 SNPs that were previously
      implicated their association with breast cancer for further replication by an
      independent set of 1653 cases and 2797 controls. We identified significant
      association of the disease with a SNP rs6788895 (P(combined) of 9.43 x 10(-8)
      with odds ratio (OR) of 1.22) in the SIAH2 (intron of seven in absentia homolog
      2) gene on chromosome 3q25.1 where the involvement in estrogen-dependent diseases
      was suggested. In addition, rs3750817 in intron 2 of the fibroblast growth factor
      receptor 2 gene, which was reported to be associated with breast cancer
      susceptibility, was significantly replicated with P(combined) of 8.47 x 10(-8)
      with OR=1.22. Our results suggest a novel susceptibility locus on chromosome
      3q25.1 for a HRP breast cancer.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in diverse populations are needed to
      reveal variants that are more common and/or limited to defined populations. We
      conducted a GWAS of breast cancer in women of African ancestry, with genotyping
      of >1,000,000 SNPs in 3,153 African American cases and 2,831 controls, and
      replication testing of the top 66 associations in an additional 3,607 breast
      cancer cases and 11,330 controls of African ancestry. Two of the 66 SNPs
      replicated (p < 0.05) in stage 2, which reached statistical significance levels
      of 10(-6) and 10(-5) in the stage 1 and 2 combined analysis (rs4322600 at
      chromosome 14q31: OR = 1.18, p = 4.3 x 10(-6); rs10510333 at chromosome 3p26: OR 
      = 1.15, p = 1.5 x 10(-5)). These suggestive risk loci have not been identified in
      previous GWAS in other populations and will need to be examined in additional
      samples. Identification of novel risk variants for breast cancer in women of
      African ancestry will demand testing of a substantially larger set of markers
      from stage 1 in a larger replication sample.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
      prostate cancer among diverse populations. To search for novel prostate cancer
      risk variants, we conducted GWAS of prostate cancer in Japanese and Latinos. In
      addition, we tested prostate cancer risk variants and developed genetic risk
      models of prostate cancer for Japanese and Latinos. METHODS: Our first-stage GWAS
      of prostate cancer included Japanese (cases/controls = 1,033/1,042) and Latino
      (cases/controls = 1,043/1,057) from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC). Significant
      associations from stage I (P < 1.0 x 10(-4)) were examined in silico in GWAS of
      prostate cancer (stage II) in Japanese (cases/controls = 1,583/3,386) and
      Europeans (cases/controls = 1,854/1,894). RESULTS: No novel stage I
      single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) outside of known risk regions reached
      genome-wide significance. For Japanese, in stage I, the most notable putative
      novel association was seen with 10 SNPs (P </= 8.0 x 10(-6)) at chromosome 2q33; 
      however, this was not replicated in stage II. For Latinos, the most significant
      association was observed with rs17023900 at the known 3p12 risk locus (stage I:
      OR = 1.45; P = 7.01 x 10(-5) and stage II: OR = 1.58; P = 3.05 x 10(-7)). The
      majority of the established risk variants for prostate cancer, 79% and 88%, were 
      positively associated with prostate cancer in Japanese and Latinos (stage I),
      respectively. The cumulative effects of these variants significantly influence
      prostate cancer risk (OR per allele = 1.10; P = 2.71 x 10(-25) and OR = 1.07; P =
      1.02 x 10(-16) for Japanese and Latinos, respectively). CONCLUSION AND IMPACT:
      Our GWAS of prostate cancer did not identify novel genome-wide significant
      variants. However, our findings show that established risk variants for prostate 
      cancer significantly contribute to risk among Japanese and Latinos.

TI  - Influence of common genetic variation on lung cancer risk: meta-analysis of 14
      900 cases and 29 485 controls.
PG  - 4980-95
LID - 10.1093/hmg/dds334 [doi]
AB  - Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified common genetic
      variants at 5p15.33, 6p21-6p22 and 15q25.1 associated with lung cancer risk.
      Several other genetic regions including variants of CHEK2 (22q12), TP53BP1
      (15q15) and RAD52 (12p13) have been demonstrated to influence lung cancer risk in
      candidate- or pathway-based analyses. To identify novel risk variants for lung
      cancer, we performed a meta-analysis of 16 GWASs, totaling 14 900 cases and 29
      485 controls of European descent. Our data provided increased support for
      previously identified risk loci at 5p15 (P = 7.2 x 10(-16)), 6p21 (P = 2.3 x
      10(-14)) and 15q25 (P = 2.2 x 10(-63)). Furthermore, we demonstrated
      histology-specific effects for 5p15, 6p21 and 12p13 loci but not for the 15q25
      region. Subgroup analysis also identified a novel disease locus for squamous cell
      carcinoma at 9p21 (CDKN2A/p16(INK4A)/p14(ARF)/CDKN2B/p15(INK4B)/ANRIL; rs1333040,
      P = 3.0 x 10(-7)) which was replicated in a series of 5415 Han Chinese (P = 0.03;
      combined analysis, P = 2.3 x 10(-8)). This large analysis provides additional
      evidence for the role of inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and
      insight into biological differences in the development of the different
      histological types of lung cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: Genetic variation may influence chemotherapy response and overall
      survival in cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a genome-wide scan
      in 535 advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from two
      independent cohorts (307 from Nanjing and 228 from Beijing). A replication was
      carried out on an independent cohort of 340 patients from Southeastern China
      followed by a second validation on 409 patients from the Massachusetts General
      Hospital (Boston, MA). RESULTS: Consistent associations with NSCLC survival were 
      identified for five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in Chinese populations 
      with P values ranging from 3.63 x 10(-5) to 4.19 x 10(-7) in the additive genetic
      model. The minor allele of three SNPs (rs7629386 at 3p22.1, rs969088 at 5p14.1,
      and rs3850370 at 14q24.3) were associated with worse NSCLC survival while 2
      (rs41997 at 7q31.31 and rs12000445 at 9p21.3) were associated with better NSCLC
      survival. In addition, rs7629386 at 3p22.1 (CTNNB1) and rs3850370 at 14q24.3
      (SNW1-ALKBH1-NRXN3) were further replicated in the Caucasian population.
      CONCLUSION: In this three-stage genome-wide association studies, we identified
      five SNPs as markers for survival of advanced-stage NSCLC patients treated with
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in Chinese Han populations. Two of these
      SNPs, rs7629386 and rs3850370, could also be markers for survival among Caucasian
      patients.

AB  - The identification of patients who are at high risk for irinotecan-related severe
      diarrhea and neutropenia is clinically important. We conducted the first
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) to search for novel susceptibility genes for
      irinotecan-related severe toxicities, such as diarrhea and neutropenia, in
      non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with irinotecan chemotherapy.
      The GWAS putatively identified 49 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      associated with grade 3 diarrhea (G3D) and 32 SNPs associated with grade 4
      neutropenia (G4N). In the replication series, the SNPs rs1517114 (C8orf34),
      rs1661167 (FLJ41856) and rs2745761 (PLCB1) were confirmed as being associated
      with G3D, whereas rs11128347 (PDZRN3) and rs11979430 and rs7779029 (SEMAC3) were 
      confirmed as being associated with G4N. The final imputation analysis of our GWAS
      and replication study showed significant overlaps of association signals within
      these novel variants. This GWAS screen, along with subsequent validation and
      imputation analysis, identified novel SNPs associated with irinotecan-related
      severe toxicities.

      cancer susceptibility.
PG  - 1531-7
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgs188 [doi]
AB  - Asbestos exposure is a known risk factor for lung cancer. Although recent
      genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified some novel loci for lung 
      cancer risk, few addressed genome-wide gene-environment interactions. To
      determine gene-asbestos interactions in lung cancer risk, we conducted
      genome-wide gene-environment interaction analyses at levels of single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and pathways, using our published Texas lung cancer
      GWAS dataset. This dataset included 317 498 SNPs from 1154 lung cancer cases and 
      1137 cancer-free controls. The initial SNP-level P-values for interactions
      between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure were estimated by
      unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, smoking
      status and pack-years. The P-value for the most significant SNP rs13383928 was
      2.17x10(-6), which did not reach the genome-wide statistical significance. Using 
      a versatile gene-based test approach, we found that the top significant gene was 
      C7orf54, located on 7q32.1 (P = 8.90x10(-5)). Interestingly, most of the other
      significant genes were located on 11q13. When we used an improved
      gene-set-enrichment analysis approach, we found that the Fas signaling pathway
      and the antigen processing and presentation pathway were most significant
      (nominal P < 0.001; false discovery rate < 0.05) among 250 pathways containing 17
      572 genes. We believe that our analysis is a pilot study that first describes the
      gene-asbestos interaction in lung cancer risk at levels of SNPs, genes and
      pathways. Our findings suggest that immune function regulation-related pathways
      may be mechanistically involved in asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.

AB  - We performed a meta-analysis of five genome-wide association studies to identify 
      common variants influencing colorectal cancer (CRC) risk comprising 8,682 cases
      and 9,649 controls. Replication analysis was performed in case-control sets
      totaling 21,096 cases and 19,555 controls. We identified three new CRC risk loci 
      at 6p21 (rs1321311, near CDKN1A; P = 1.14 x 10(-10)), 11q13.4 (rs3824999,
      intronic to POLD3; P = 3.65 x 10(-10)) and Xp22.2 (rs5934683, near SHROOM2; P =
      7.30 x 10(-10)) This brings the number of independent loci associated with CRC
      risk to 20 and provides further insight into the genetic architecture of
      inherited susceptibility to CRC.

TI  - A genome-wide association study identifies a breast cancer risk variant in ERBB4 
      at 2q34: results from the Seoul Breast Cancer Study.
PG  - R56
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although approximately 25 common genetic susceptibility loci have
      been identified to be independently associated with breast cancer risk through
      genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the genetic risk variants reported to
      date only explain a small fraction of the heritability of breast cancer.
      Furthermore, GWAS-identified loci were primarily identified in women of European 
      descent. METHODS: To evaluate previously identified loci in Korean women and to
      identify additional novel breast cancer susceptibility variants, we conducted a
      three-stage GWAS that included 6,322 cases and 5,897 controls. RESULTS: In the
      validation study using Stage I of the 2,273 cases and 2,052 controls, seven
      GWAS-identified loci [5q11.2/MAP3K1 (rs889312 and rs16886165), 5p15.2/ROPN1L
      (rs1092913), 5q12/MRPS30 (rs7716600), 6q25.1/ESR1 (rs2046210 and rs3734802),
      8q24.21 (rs1562430), 10q26.13/FGFR2 (rs10736303), and 16q12.1/TOX3 (rs4784227 and
      rs3803662)] were significantly associated with breast cancer risk in Korean women
      (Ptrend < 0.05). To identify additional genetic risk variants, we selected the
      most promising 17 SNPs in Stage I and replicated these SNPs in 2,052 cases and
      2,169 controls (Stage II). Four SNPs were further evaluated in 1,997 cases and
      1,676 controls (Stage III). SNP rs13393577 at chromosome 2q34, located in the
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 4 (ERBB4) gene, showed a consistent association 
      with breast cancer risk with combined odds ratios (95% CI) of 1.53 (1.37-1.70)
      (combined P for trend = 8.8 x 10-14). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that seven
      breast cancer susceptibility loci, which were previously identified in European
      and/or Chinese populations, could be directly replicated in Korean women.
      Furthermore, this study provides strong evidence implicating rs13393577 at 2q34
      as a new risk variant for breast cancer.

AB  - Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and
      familial breast cancer. We aimed to discover novel genetic susceptibility loci
      for breast cancer. We conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS)
      in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent including Chinese,
      Korean, and Japanese women. After analyzing 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324
      controls, we evaluated 5,365 SNPs for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852
      controls. Ninety-four SNPs were further evaluated in 5,203 cases and 5,138
      controls, and finally the top 22 SNPs were investigated in up to 17,423
      additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls). SNP rs9485372, near the
      TGF-beta activated kinase (TAB2) gene in chromosome 6q25.1, showed a consistent
      association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of
      3.8x10(-12) in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios (95%
      confidence intervals) were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for the A/G and 
      A/A genotypes, respectively, compared with the genotype G/G. SNP rs9383951 (P =
      1.9x10(-6) from the combined analysis of all samples), located in intron 5 of the
      ESR1 gene, and SNP rs7107217 (P = 4.6x10(-7)), located at 11q24.3, also showed a 
      consistent association in each of the four stages. This study provides strong
      evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372,
      near the TAB2 gene (6q25.1), and identifies two possible susceptibility loci
      located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively.

AB  - Gallbladder cancer (GC) is a relatively uncommon cancer with higher incidence in 
      certain areas including Japan. Because of the difficulty in diagnosis, prognosis 
      of GC is very poor. To identify genetic determinants of GC, we conducted a
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 41 GC patients and 866 controls.
      Association between each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with GC
      susceptibility was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis
      conditioned on age and gender of subjects. SNPs that showed suggestive
      association (P<1 x 10(-4)) with GC were further examined in 30 cases and 898
      controls. SNP rs7504990 in the DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer, 18q21.3) that
      encodes a netrin 1 receptor achieved a combined P-value of 7.46 x 10(-8)
      (OR=6.95; 95% CI=3.43-14.08). Subsequent imputation analysis identified multiple 
      SNPs with similarly strong associations in an adjacent genomic region, where loss
      of heterozygosity was reported in GC and other cancers. Reduced expression of DCC
      was indicated to be associated with the poorly differentiated histological type, 
      increased proliferation and metastasis through loss of adhesiveness. However, due
      to the limited sample size investigated here, further replication study and
      functional analysis would be necessary to further confirm the result of the
      association.

PG  - 229-35

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Genetic factors are thought to be one of the causes of individual
      variability in the adverse reactions observed in cancer patients who received
      gemcitabine therapy. However, genetic factors determining the risk of adverse
      reactions of gemcitabine are not fully understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To
      identify a genetic factor(s) determining the risk of gemcitabine-induced
      leukopenia/neutropenia, we conducted a genome-wide association study, by
      genotyping over 610 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and a replication
      study in a total of 174 patients, including 54 patients with at least grade 3
      leukopenia/neutropenia and 120 patients without any toxicities. RESULTS: We
      identified four loci possibly associated with gemcitabine-induced
      leukopenia/neutropenia [rs11141915 in DAPK1 on chromosome 9q21, combined
      P=1.27x10, odds ratio (OR)=4.10; rs1901440 on chromosome 2q12, combined
      P=3.11x10, OR=34.00; rs12046844 in PDE4B on chromosome 1p31, combined P=4.56x10, 
      OR=4.13; rs11719165 on chromosome 3q29, combined P=5.98x10, OR=2.60]. When we
      examined the combined effects of these four SNPs, by classifying patients into
      four groups on the basis of the total number of risk genotypes of these four
      SNPs, significantly higher risks of gemcitabine-induced leukopenia/neutropenia
      were observed in the patients having two and three risk genotypes (P=6.25x10,
      OR=11.97 and P=4.13x10, OR=50.00, respectively) relative to patients with zero or
      one risk genotype. CONCLUSION: We identified four novel SNPs associated with
      gemcitabine-induced severe leukopenia/neutropenia. These SNPs might be applicable
      in predicting the risk of hematological toxicity in patients receiving
      gemcitabine therapy.

      risk.
PG  - 319-22
LID - 10.1038/ng.1046 [doi]
AB  - To search for sequence variants conferring risk of nonmedullary thyroid cancer,
      we focused our analysis on 22 SNPs with a P < 5 x 10(-8) in a genome-wide
      association study on levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in 27,758
      Icelanders. Of those, rs965513 has previously been shown to associate with
      thyroid cancer. The remaining 21 SNPs were genotyped in 561 Icelandic individuals
      with thyroid cancer (cases) and up to 40,013 controls. Variants suggestively
      associated with thyroid cancer (P < 0.05) were genotyped in an additional 595
      non-Icelandic cases and 2,604 controls. After combining the results, three
      variants were shown to associate with thyroid cancer: rs966423 on 2q35 (OR =
      1.34; P(combined) = 1.3 x 10(-9)), rs2439302 on 8p12 (OR = 1.36; P(combined) =
      2.0 x 10(-9)) and rs116909374 on 14q13.3 (OR = 2.09; P(combined) = 4.6 x
      10(-11)), a region previously reported to contain an uncorrelated variant
      conferring risk of thyroid cancer. A strong association (P = 9.1 x 10(-91)) was
      observed between rs2439302 on 8p12 and expression of NRG1, which encodes the
      signaling protein neuregulin 1, in blood.

AB  - Only two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to date to
      identify potential markers for total mortality after diagnosis of breast cancer. 
      Here, we report the identification of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
      associated with total mortality from a two-stage GWAS conducted among 6,110
      Shanghai-resident Chinese women with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage I to IV
      breast cancer. The discovery stage included 1,950 patients and evaluated 613,031 
      common SNPs. The top 49 associations were evaluated in an independent replication
      stage of 4,160 Shanghai patients with breast cancer. A consistent and highly
      significant association with total mortality was documented for SNPs rs3784099
      and rs9934948. SNP rs3784099, located in the RAD51L1 gene, was associated with
      total morality in both the discovery stage (P = 1.44 x 10(-8)) and replication
      stage (P = 0.06; P-combined = 1.17 x 10(-7)). Adjusted HRs for total mortality
      were 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.68] for the AG genotype and 2.64 
      (95% CI, 1.74-4.03) for the AA genotype, when compared with the GG genotype. The 
      variant C allele of rs9934948, located on chromosome 16, was associated with a
      similarly elevated risk of total mortality (P-combined = 5.75 x 10(-6)). We also 
      observed this association among 1,145 patients with breast cancer of European
      ancestry from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS; P = 0.006); the association was
      highly significant in a combined analysis of NHS and Chinese data (P = 1.39 x
      10(-7)). Similar associations were observed for these two SNPs with breast
      cancer-specific mortality. This study provides strong evidence suggesting that
      the RAD51L1 gene and a chromosome 16 locus influence breast cancer prognosis.

TI  - A genome-wide search for loci interacting with known prostate cancer
      risk-associated genetic variants.
PG  - 598-603
LID - 10.1093/carcin/bgr316 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 30
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) consistently associated with prostate
      cancer (PCa) risk. To test the hypothesis that other sequence variants in the
      genome may interact with those 32 known PCa risk-associated SNPs identified from 
      GWAS to affect PCa risk, we performed a systematic evaluation among three
      existing PCa GWAS populations: CAncer of the Prostate in Sweden population, a
      Johns Hopkins Hospital population, and the Cancer Genetic Markers of
      Susceptibility population, with a total sample size of 4723 PCa cases and 4792
      control subjects. Meta-analysis of the interaction term between each of those 32 
      SNPs and SNPs in the genome was performed in three PCa GWAS populations. The most
      significant interaction detected was between rs12418451 in MYEOV and rs784411 in 
      CEP152, with a P(interaction) of 1.15 x 10(-7) in the meta-analysis. In addition,
      we emphasized two pairs of interactions with potential biological implication,
      including an interaction between rs7127900 near insulin-like growth factor-2
      (IGF2)/IGF2AS and rs12628051 in TNRC6B, with a P(interaction) of 3.39 x 10(-6)
      and an interaction between rs7679763 near TET2 and rs290258 in SYK, with a
      P(interaction) of 1.49 x 10(-6). Those results show statistical evidence for
      novel loci interacting with known risk-associated SNPs to modify PCa risk. The
      interacting loci identified provide hints on the underlying molecular mechanism
      of the associations with PCa risk for the known risk-associated SNPs. Additional 
      studies are warranted to further confirm the interaction effects detected in this
      study.

AB  - Although many association studies of polymorphisms in candidate genes with the
      clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy 
      have been reported, genetic factors determining individual response to tamoxifen 
      are not fully understood. To identify genetic polymorphisms associated with
      clinical outcomes of patients with tamoxifen treatment, we conducted a
      genome-wide association study (GWAS). We studied 462 Japanese patients with
      hormone receptor-positive, invasive breast cancer receiving adjuvant tamoxifen
      therapy. Of them, 240 patients were analyzed by genome-wide genotyping using the 
      Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChips, and two independent sets of 105 and 117 cases
      were used for replication studies. In the GWAS, we detected significant
      associations with recurrence-free survival at 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs) on nine chromosomal loci (1p31, 1q41, 5q33, 7p11, 10q22, 12q13, 13q22,
      18q12 and 19p13) that satisfied a genome-wide significant threshold (log-rank P= 
      2.87 x 10(-9)-9.41 x 10(-8)). Among them, rs10509373 in C10orf11 gene on 10q22
      was significantly associated with recurrence-free survival in the replication
      study (log-rank P= 2.02 x 10(-4)) and a combined analysis indicated a strong
      association of this SNP with recurrence-free survival in breast cancer patients
      treated with tamoxifen (log-rank P= 1.26 x 10(-10)). Hazard ratio per C allele of
      rs10509373 was 4.51 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.72-7.51; P= 6.29 x 10(-9)]. 
      In a combined analysis of rs10509373 genotype with previously identified genetic 
      makers, CYP2D6 and ABCC2, the number of risk alleles of these three genes had
      cumulative effects on recurrence-free survival among 345 patients receiving
      tamoxifen monotherapy (log-rank P= 2.28 x 10(-12)). In conclusion, we identified 
      a novel locus associated with recurrence-free survival in Japanese breast cancer 
      patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate among human cancers, and there are
      no effective markers for its screening and early diagnosis. To identify genetic
      susceptibility markers for this cancer, we carried out a genome-wide association 
      study on 981 individuals with pancreatic cancer (cases) and 1,991 cancer-free
      controls of Chinese descent using 666,141 autosomal SNPs. Promising associations 
      were replicated in an additional 2,603 pancreatic cancer cases and 2,877 controls
      recruited from 25 hospitals in 16 provinces or cities in China. We identified
      five new susceptibility loci at chromosomes 21q21.3, 5p13.1, 21q22.3, 22q13.32
      and 10q26.11 (P = 2.24 x 10(-13) to P = 4.18 x 10(-10)) in addition to 13q22.1
      previously reported in populations of European ancestry. These results advance
      our understanding of the development of pancreatic cancer and highlight potential
      targets for the prevention or treatment of this cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303 was a randomized, phase
      III study in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine
      plus either bevacizumab or placebo. We prospectively collected germline DNA and
      conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using overall survival (OS) as
      the endpoint. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA from 351 patients was genotyped for more
      than 550,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Associations between OS and
      SNPs were investigated using the log-linear 2-way multiplicative Cox proportional
      hazards model. The subset of 294 genetically European patients was used for the
      primary analysis. RESULTS: A nonsynonymous SNP in interleukin (IL)17F (rs763780, 
      H161R) and an intronic SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium (rs7771466) were
      associated with OS using genome-wide criteria (P </= 10(-7)). Median OS was
      significantly shorter (P = 2.61 x 10(-8)) for the rs763780 heterozygotes [3.1
      months; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.3-4.3] than for the patients without this
      variant (6.8 months; 95% CI, 5.8-7.3). After adjustment by stratification
      factors, the P value for the association was 9.51 x 10(-7). CONCLUSIONS: The
      variant 161R form of IL-17F is a natural antagonist of the antiangiogenic effects
      of wild-type 161H IL-17F, and angiogenesis may play an important role in the
      metastatic spread of pancreatic cancer. In this preliminary study, we hypothesize
      that the angiogenetic potential of pancreatic cancers in patients with variant
      IL-17F is higher than that of tumors in patients with wild-type IL-17F,
      conferring worse prognosis. This exploratory GWAS may provide the foundation for 
      testing the biology and clinical effects of novel genes and their heritable
      variants through mechanistic and confirmatory studies in pancreatic cancer.

TI  - New variants at 10q26 and 15q21 are associated with aggressive prostate cancer in
      a genome-wide association study from a prostate biopsy screening cohort.
PG  - 997-1004
LID - 10.4161/cbt.12.11.18366 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify and examine polymorphisms of genes associated with
      aggressive and clinical significant forms of prostate cancer among a screening
      cohort. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a genome-wide association study among
      patients with aggressive forms of prostate cancer and biopsy-proven normal
      controls ascertained from a prostate cancer screening program. We then examined
      significant associations of specific polymorphisms among a prostate cancer
      screened cohort to examine their predictive ability in detecting prostate cancer.
      RESULTS: We found significant associations between aggressive prostate cancer and
      five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 10q26 (rs10788165, rs10749408,
      and rs10788165, p value for association 1.3 x 10(-10 ) to 3.2 x 10(-11) ) and
      15q21 (rs4775302 and rs1994198, p values for association 3.1 x 10(-8 ) to 8.2 x
      10(-9)) regions. Results of a replication study done in 3439 patients undergoing 
      a prostate biopsy, revealed certain combinations of these SNPs to be
      significantly associated not only with prostate cancer but with aggressive forms 
      of prostate cancer using an established classification criterion for prostate
      cancer progression (odds ratios for intermediate to high-risk disease 1.8-3.0, p 
      value 0.003-0.001). These SNP combinations were also important clinical
      predictors for prostate cancer detection based on nomogram analysis that assesses
      prostate cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Five SNPs were found to be associated with
      aggressive forms of prostate cancer. We demonstrated potential clinical
      applications of these associations.

TI  - A common variant at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus is associated with estrogen
      receptor-negative breast cancer.
PG  - 1210-4
LID - 10.1038/ng.985 [doi]
AB  - Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer shows a higher incidence in women
      of African ancestry compared to women of European ancestry. In search of common
      risk alleles for ER-negative breast cancer, we combined genome-wide association
      study (GWAS) data from women of African ancestry (1,004 ER-negative cases and
      2,745 controls) and European ancestry (1,718 ER-negative cases and 3,670
      controls), with replication testing conducted in an additional 2,292 ER-negative 
      cases and 16,901 controls of European ancestry. We identified a common risk
      variant for ER-negative breast cancer at the TERT-CLPTM1L locus on chromosome
      5p15 (rs10069690: per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.18 per allele, P = 1.0 x
      10(-10)). The variant was also significantly associated with triple-negative
      (ER-negative, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative and human epidermal growth
      factor-2 (HER2)-negative) breast cancer (OR = 1.25, P = 1.1 x 10(-9)),
      particularly in younger women (<50 years of age) (OR = 1.48, P = 1.9 x 10(-9)).
      Our results identify a genetic locus associated with estrogen receptor negative
      breast cancer subtypes in multiple populations.

AB  - Gastric cancer, including the cardia and non-cardia types, is the second leading 
      cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To identify genetic risk variants for
      non-cardia gastric cancer, we performed a genome-wide association study in 3,279 
      individuals (1,006 with non-cardia gastric cancer and 2,273 controls) of Chinese 
      descent. We replicated significant associations in an additional 6,897 subjects
      (3,288 with non-cardia gastric cancer and 3,609 controls). We identified two new 
      susceptibility loci for non-cardia gastric cancer at 5p13.1 (rs13361707 in the
      region including PTGER4 and PRKAA1; odds ratio (OR) = 1.41; P = 7.6 x 10(-29))
      and 3q13.31 (rs9841504 in ZBTB20; OR = 0.76; P = 1.7 x 10(-9)). Imputation
      analyses also confirmed previously reported associations of rs2294008 and
      rs2976392 on 8q24, rs4072037 on 1q22 and rs13042395 on 20p13 with non-cardia
      gastric cancer susceptibility in the Han Chinese population.

TI  - Mutations in BRIP1 confer high risk of ovarian cancer.
PG  - 1104-7
LID - 10.1038/ng.955 [doi]
AB  - Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other gynecologic malignancy in
      developed countries. Sixteen million sequence variants, identified through
      whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders, were imputed to 41,675 Icelanders
      genotyped using SNP chips, as well as to their relatives. Sequence variants were 
      tested for association with ovarian cancer (N of affected individuals = 656). We 
      discovered a rare (0.41% allelic frequency) frameshift mutation,
      c.2040_2041insTT, in the BRIP1 (FANCJ) gene that confers an increase in ovarian
      cancer risk (odds ratio (OR) = 8.13, P = 2.8 x 10(-14)). The mutation was also
      associated with increased risk of cancer in general and reduced lifespan by 3.6
      years. In a Spanish population, another frameshift mutation in BRIP1,
      c.1702_1703del, was seen in 2 out of 144 subjects with ovarian cancer and 1 out
      of 1,780 control subjects (P = 0.016). This allele was also associated with
      breast cancer (seen in 6/927 cases; P = 0.0079). Ovarian tumors from heterozygous
      carriers of the Icelandic mutation show loss of the wild-type allele, indicating 
      that BRIP1 behaves like a classical tumor suppressor gene in ovarian cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies breast cancer risk variant at 10q21.2:
      results from the Asia Breast Cancer Consortium.
PG  - 4991-9
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr405 [doi]
AB  - Although approximately 20 common genetic susceptibility loci have been identified
      for breast cancer risk through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), genetic
      risk variants reported to date explain only a small fraction of heritability for 
      this common cancer. We conducted a four-stage GWAS including 17 153 cases and 16 
      943 controls among East-Asian women to search for new genetic risk factors for
      breast cancer. After analyzing 684 457 SNPs in 2062 cases and 2066 controls
      (Stage I), we selected for replication among 5969 Chinese women (4146 cases and
      1823 controls) the top 49 SNPs that had neither been reported previously nor were
      in strong linkage disequilibrium with reported SNPs (Stage II). Three SNPs were
      further evaluated in up to 13 152 Chinese and Japanese women (6436 cases and 6716
      controls) (Stage III). Finally, two SNPs were evaluated in 10 847 Korean women
      (4509 cases and 6338 controls) (Stage IV). SNP rs10822013 on chromosome 10q21.2, 
      located in the zinc finger protein 365 (ZNF365) gene, showed a consistent
      association with breast cancer risk in all four stages with a combined per-risk
      allele odds ratio of 1.10 (95% CI: 1.07-1.14) (P-value for trend = 5.87 x
      10(-9)). In vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated the
      potential functional significance of rs10822013. Our results strongly implicate
      rs10822013 at 10q21.2 as a genetic risk variant for breast cancer among
      East-Asian women.

TI  - The 18p11.22 locus is associated with never smoker non-small cell lung cancer
      susceptibility in Korean populations.
PG  - 365-72
LID - 10.1007/s00439-011-1080-z [doi]
AB  - The proportion of never smoker non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Asia is
      about 30-40%. Despite the striking demographics and high prevalence of never
      smoker NSCLC, the exact causes still remain undetermined. Although several genome
      wide association (GWA) studies were conducted to find susceptibility loci for
      lung cancer in never smokers, no regions were replicated except for 5p15.33,
      suggesting locus heterogeneity and different environmental toxic effects. To
      identify genetic loci associated with susceptibility of lung cancer in never
      smokers, we performed a GWA analysis using the Affymetrix 6.0 SNP array. For
      discovery GWA set, we recruited 446 never smoking Korean patients with NSCLC and 
      497 normal subjects. We tested association of SNPs with lung cancer
      susceptibility using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. For validation, 39 SNPs
      were selected from the top 50 SNPs and five additional SNPs were selected in the 
      DAB1 gene region which showed significant associations in the GWA analysis. The
      validation SNPs were genotyped in an independent sample including 434 patients
      and 1,000 controls. Among the 44 validation SNPs, two SNPs (rs11080466 and
      rs11663246) near the APCDD1, NAPG and FAM38B genes in the 18p11.22 region were
      replicated. P value of rs11080466 was 1.08 x 10(-6) in the combined sets (2.68 x 
      10(-5) in the discovery set and 2.60 x 10(-3) in the validation set) and odds
      ratio was 0.68 (0.58-0.79). We observed similar association for rs11663246. Our
      result suggests the 18p11.22 region as a novel lung cancer susceptibility locus
      in never smokers.

AB  - Genome-wide and candidate-gene association studies of bladder cancer have
      identified 10 susceptibility loci thus far. We conducted a meta-analysis of two
      previously published genome-wide scans (4501 cases and 6076 controls of European 
      background) and followed up the most significant association signals [17 single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genomic regions] in 1382 cases and 2201
      controls from four studies. A combined analysis adjusted for study center, age,
      sex, and smoking status identified a novel susceptibility locus that mapped to a 
      region of 18q12.3, marked by rs7238033 (P = 8.7 x 10(-9); allelic odds ratio 1.20
      with 95% CI: 1.13-1.28) and two highly correlated SNPs, rs10775480/rs10853535
      (r(2)= 1.00; P = 8.9 x 10(-9); allelic odds ratio 1.16 with 95% CI: 1.10-1.22).
      The signal localizes to the solute carrier family 14 member 1 gene, SLC14A1, a
      urea transporter that regulates cellular osmotic pressure. In the kidney, SLC14A1
      regulates urine volume and concentration whereas in erythrocytes it determines
      the Kidd blood groups. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in SLC14A1
      could provide new etiological insights into bladder carcinogenesis.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in developed
      countries. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified
      novel susceptibility loci for colorectal cancer. To follow up on these findings, 
      and try to identify novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we present
      results for GWAS of colorectal cancer (2,906 cases, 3,416 controls) that have not
      previously published main associations. Specifically, we calculated odds ratios
      and 95% confidence intervals using log-additive models for each study. In order
      to improve our power to detect novel colorectal cancer susceptibility loci, we
      performed a meta-analysis combining the results across studies. We selected the
      most statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for
      replication using ten independent studies (8,161 cases and 9,101 controls). We
      again used a meta-analysis to summarize results for the replication studies
      alone, and for a combined analysis of GWAS and replication studies. We measured
      ten SNPs previously identified in colorectal cancer susceptibility loci and found
      eight to be associated with colorectal cancer (p value range 0.02 to 1.8 x
      10(-8)). When we excluded studies that have previously published on these SNPs,
      five SNPs remained significant at p < 0.05 in the combined analysis. No novel
      susceptibility loci were significant in the replication study after adjustment
      for multiple testing, and none reached genome-wide significance from a combined
      analysis of GWAS and replication. We observed marginally significant evidence for
      a second independent SNP in the BMP2 region at chromosomal location 20p12
      (rs4813802; replication p value 0.03; combined p value 7.3 x 10(-5)). In a region
      on 5p33.15, which includes the coding regions of the TERT-CLPTM1L genes and has
      been identified in GWAS to be associated with susceptibility to at least seven
      other cancers, we observed a marginally significant association with rs2853668
      (replication p value 0.03; combined p value 1.9 x 10(-4)). Our study suggests a
      complex nature of the contribution of common genetic variants to risk for
      colorectal cancer.

AB  - Three genome-wide association studies in Europe and the USA have reported eight
      urinary bladder cancer (UBC) susceptibility loci. Using extended case and control
      series and 1000 Genomes imputations of 5 340 737 single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
      (SNPs), we searched for additional loci in the European GWAS. The discovery
      sample set consisted of 1631 cases and 3822 controls from the Netherlands and 603
      cases and 37 781 controls from Iceland. For follow-up, we used 3790 cases and
      7507 controls from 13 sample sets of European and Iranian ancestry. Based on the 
      discovery analysis, we followed up signals in the urea transporter (UT) gene
      SLC14A. The strongest signal at this locus was represented by a SNP in intron 3, 
      rs17674580, that reached genome-wide significance in the overall analysis of the 
      discovery and follow-up groups: odds ratio = 1.17, P = 7.6 x 10(-11). SLC14A1
      codes for UTs that define the Kidd blood group and are crucial for the
      maintenance of a constant urea concentration gradient in the renal medulla and,
      through this, the kidney's ability to concentrate urine. It is speculated that
      rs17674580, or other sequence variants in LD with it, indirectly modifies UBC
      risk by affecting urine production. If confirmed, this would support the
      'urogenous contact hypothesis' that urine production and voiding frequency modify
      the risk of UBC.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most frequently diagnosed male cancer in developed 
      countries. We conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study for PrCa and 
      previously reported the results of the first two stages, which identified 16 PrCa
      susceptibility loci. We report here the results of stage 3, in which we evaluated
      1,536 SNPs in 4,574 individuals with prostate cancer (cases) and 4,164 controls. 
      We followed up ten new association signals through genotyping in 51,311 samples
      in 30 studies from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer
      Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium. In addition to
      replicating previously reported loci, we identified seven new prostate cancer
      susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2p11, 3q23, 3q26, 5p12, 6p21, 12q13 and Xq12
      (P = 4.0 x 10(-8) to P = 2.7 x 10(-24)). We also identified a SNP in TERT more
      strongly associated with PrCa than that previously reported. More than 40 PrCa
      susceptibility loci, explaining approximately 25% of the familial risk in this
      disease, have now been identified.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies new prostate cancer susceptibility loci.
PG  - 3867-75
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr295 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most common non-skin cancer diagnosed among males
      in developed countries and the second leading cause of cancer mortality, yet
      little is known regarding its etiology and factors that influence clinical
      outcome. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of PrCa have identified at least 
      30 distinct loci associated with small differences in risk. We conducted a GWAS
      in 2782 advanced PrCa cases (Gleason grade >/= 8 or tumor stage C/D) and 4458
      controls with 571 243 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Based on in silico 
      replication of 4679 SNPs (Stage 1, P < 0.02) in two published GWAS with 7358 PrCa
      cases and 6732 controls, we identified a new susceptibility locus associated with
      overall PrCa risk at 2q37.3 (rs2292884, P= 4.3 x 10(-8)). We also confirmed a
      locus suggested by an earlier GWAS at 12q13 (rs902774, P= 8.6 x 10(-9)). The
      estimated per-allele odds ratios for these loci (1.14 for rs2292884 and 1.17 for 
      rs902774) did not differ between advanced and non-advanced PrCa (case-only test
      for heterogeneity P= 0.72 and P= 0.61, respectively). Further studies will be
      needed to assess whether these or other loci are differentially associated with
      PrCa subtypes.

TI  - A genome-wide association study identifies two new lung cancer susceptibility
      loci at 13q12.12 and 22q12.2 in Han Chinese.

AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. To identify 
      genetic factors that modify the risk of lung cancer in individuals of Chinese
      ancestry, we performed a genome-wide association scan in 5,408 subjects (2,331
      individuals with lung cancer (cases) and 3,077 controls) followed by a two-stage 
      validation among 12,722 subjects (6,313 cases and 6,409 controls). The combined
      analyses identified six well-replicated SNPs with independent effects and
      significant lung cancer associations (P < 5.0 x 10(-8)) located in TP63
      (rs4488809 at 3q28, P = 7.2 x 10(-26)), TERT-CLPTM1L (rs465498 and rs2736100 at
      5p15.33, P = 1.2 x 10(-20) and P = 1.0 x 10(-27), respectively), MIPEP-TNFRSF19
      (rs753955 at 13q12.12, P = 1.5 x 10(-12)) and MTMR3-HORMAD2-LIF (rs17728461 and
      rs36600 at 22q12.2, P = 1.1 x 10(-11) and P = 6.2 x 10(-13), respectively). Two
      of these loci (13q12.12 and 22q12.2) were newly identified in the Chinese
      population. These results suggest that genetic variants in 3q28, 5p15.33,
      13q12.12 and 22q12.2 may contribute to the susceptibility of lung cancer in Han
      Chinese.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies three new susceptibility loci for
      esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma in Chinese populations.
PG  - 679-84
LID - 10.1038/ng.849 [doi]
AB  - Esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers
      worldwide and occurs at a relatively high frequency in China. To identify genetic
      susceptibility loci for ESCC, we conducted a genome-wide association study on
      2,031 individuals with ESCC (cases) and 2,044 controls of Chinese descent using
      666,141 autosomal SNPs. We evaluated promising associations in an additional
      6,276 cases and 6,165 controls of Chinese descent from different areas of China. 
      We identified seven susceptibility loci on chromosomes 5q11, 6p21, 10q23, 12q24
      and 21q22 (ranging from P = 7.48 x 10(-12) to P = 2.44 x 10(-31)); among these
      loci, 5q11, 6p21 and 21q22 were newly identified. Three variants in high linkage 
      disequilibrium on 12q24 confer their risks to ESCC in a gene-lifestyle
      interaction manner, with more pronounced risk enhancement seen in tobacco and
      alcohol users. Furthermore, the identified variants had a cumulative association 
      with ESCC risk (P(trend) = 7.92 x 10(-56)). These findings highlight the
      involvement of multiple genetic loci and gene-environment interaction in the
      development of esophageal cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry
      identifies a susceptibility locus at 17q21.
PG  - 570-3
LID - 10.1038/ng.839 [doi]
AB  - In search of common risk alleles for prostate cancer that could contribute to
      high rates of the disease in men of African ancestry, we conducted a genome-wide 
      association study, with 1,047,986 SNP markers examined in 3,425 African-Americans
      with prostate cancer (cases) and 3,290 African-American male controls. We
      followed up the most significant 17 new associations from stage 1 in 1,844 cases 
      and 3,269 controls of African ancestry. We identified a new risk variant on
      chromosome 17q21 (rs7210100, odds ratio per allele = 1.51, P = 3.4 x 10(-13)).
      The frequency of the risk allele is approximately 5% in men of African descent,
      whereas it is rare in other populations (<1%). Further studies are needed to
      investigate the biological contribution of this allele to prostate cancer risk.
      These findings emphasize the importance of conducting genome-wide association
      studies in diverse populations.

TI  - A second independent locus within DMRT1 is associated with testicular germ cell
      tumor susceptibility.
PG  - 3109-17
LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddr207 [doi]
AB  - Susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) has a significant heritable 
      component, and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified
      association with variants in several genes, including KITLG, SPRY4, BAK1, TERT,
      DMRT1 and ATF7IP. In our GWAS, we genotyped 349 TGCT cases and 919 controls and
      replicated top hits in an independent set of 439 cases and 960 controls in an
      attempt to find novel TGCT susceptibility loci. We identified a second marker
      (rs7040024) in the doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1)
      gene that is independent of the previously described risk allele (rs755383) at
      this locus. In combined analysis that mutually conditions on both DMRT1 single
      nucleotide polymorphism markers, TGCT cases had elevated odds of carriage of the 
      rs7040024 major A allele [per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.48, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 1.23, 1.78; P = 2.52 x 10(-5)] compared with controls, while the
      association with rs755383 persisted (per allele OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.08, 1.47, P =
      0.0036). In similar analyses, the association of rs7040024 among men with
      seminomatous tumors did not differ from that among men with non-seminomatous
      tumors. In combination with KITLG, the strongest TGCT susceptibility locus found 
      to date, men with TGCT had greatly elevated odds (OR = 14.1, 95% CI 5.12, 38.6; P
      = 2.98 x 10(-7)) of being double homozygotes for the risk (major) alleles at DMRT
      (rs7040024) and KITLG (rs4474514) when compared with men without TGCT. Our
      findings continue to corroborate that genes influencing male germ cell
      development and differentiation have emerged as the major players in inherited
      TGCT susceptibility.

AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract in
      developed countries. To identify genetic variants associated with endometrial
      cancer risk, we performed a genome-wide association study involving 1,265
      individuals with endometrial cancer (cases) from Australia and the UK and 5,190
      controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We compared genotype
      frequencies in cases and controls for 519,655 SNPs. Forty seven SNPs that showed 
      evidence of association with endometrial cancer in stage 1 were genotyped in
      3,957 additional cases and 6,886 controls. We identified an endometrial cancer
      susceptibility locus close to HNF1B at 17q12 (rs4430796, P = 7.1 x 10(-10)) that 
      is also associated with risk of prostate cancer and is inversely associated with 
      risk of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interindividual variation in genetic background may influence the
      response to chemotherapy and overall survival for patients with advanced-stage
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: To identify genetic variants
      associated with poor overall survival in these patients, we conducted a
      genome-wide scan of 307,260 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 327
      advanced-stage NSCLC patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy with or
      without radiation at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (the
      discovery population). A fast-track replication was performed for 315 patients
      from the Mayo Clinic followed by a second validation at the University of
      Pittsburgh in 420 patients enrolled in the Spanish Lung Cancer Group PLATAX
      clinical trial. A pooled analysis combining the Mayo Clinic and PLATAX
      populations or all three populations was also used to validate the results. We
      assessed the association of each SNP with overall survival by multivariable Cox
      proportional hazard regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided.
      RESULTS: SNP rs1878022 in the chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) was
      statistically significantly associated with poor overall survival in the MD
      Anderson discovery population (hazard ratio [HR] of death = 1.59, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] = 1.32 to 1.92, P = 1.42 x 10(-6)), in the PLATAX clinical trial
      (HR of death = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.51, P = .05), in the pooled Mayo Clinic
      and PLATAX validation (HR of death = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.06 to 1.40, P = .005), and 
      in pooled analysis of all three populations (HR of death = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.19 to
      1.48, P = 5.13 x 10(-7)). Carrying a variant genotype of rs10937823 was
      associated with decreased overall survival (HR of death = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.42 to 
      2.33, P = 1.73 x 10(-6)) in the pooled MD Anderson and Mayo Clinic populations
      but not in the PLATAX trial patient population (HR of death = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.69
      to 1.35). CONCLUSION: These results have the potential to contribute to the
      future development of personalized chemotherapy treatments for individual NSCLC
      patients.

      within the INHANCE consortium.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001333 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying common
      genetic variation involved in susceptibility to etiologically complex disease. We
      conducted a GWAS to identify common genetic variation involved in susceptibility 
      to upper aero-digestive tract (UADT) cancers. Genome-wide genotyping was carried 
      out using the Illumina HumanHap300 beadchips in 2,091 UADT cancer cases and 3,513
      controls from two large European multi-centre UADT cancer studies, as well as
      4,821 generic controls. The 19 top-ranked variants were investigated further in
      an additional 6,514 UADT cancer cases and 7,892 controls of European descent from
      an additional 13 UADT cancer studies participating in the INHANCE consortium.
      Five common variants presented evidence for significant association in the
      combined analysis (p </= 5 x 10(-)(7)). Two novel variants were identified, a
      4q21 variant (rs1494961, p = 1x10(-)(8)) located near DNA repair related genes
      HEL308 and FAM175A (or Abraxas) and a 12q24 variant (rs4767364, p =2 x 10(-)(8)) 
      located in an extended linkage disequilibrium region that contains multiple genes
      including the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) gene. Three remaining variants are
      located in the ADH gene cluster and were identified previously in a candidate
      gene study involving some of these samples. The association between these three
      variants and UADT cancers was independently replicated in 5,092 UADT cancer cases
      and 6,794 controls non-overlapping samples presented here (rs1573496-ADH7, p = 5 
      x 10(-)(8)); rs1229984-ADH1B, p = 7 x 10(-)(9); and rs698-ADH1C, p = 0.02). These
      results implicate two variants at 4q21 and 12q24 and further highlight three ADH 
      variants in UADT cancer susceptibility.

      study for breast cancer susceptibility.
PG  - 529-37

AB  - Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown several risk alleles
      to be associated with breast cancer. However, the variants identified so far
      contribute to only a small proportion of disease risk. The objective of our GWAS 
      was to identify additional novel breast cancer susceptibility variants and to
      replicate these findings in an independent cohort. We performed a two-stage
      association study in a cohort of 3,064 women from Alberta, Canada. In Stage I, we
      interrogated 906,600 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on Affymetrix SNP 6.0
      arrays using 348 breast cancer cases and 348 controls. We used single-locus
      association tests to determine statistical significance for the observed
      differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls. In Stage II, we
      attempted to replicate 35 significant markers identified in Stage I in an
      independent study of 1,153 cases and 1,215 controls. Genotyping of Stage II
      samples was done using Sequenom Mass-ARRAY iPlex platform. Six loci from four
      different gene regions (chromosomes 4, 5, 16 and 19) showed statistically
      significant differences between cases and controls in both Stage I and Stage II
      testing, and also in joint analysis. The identified variants were from EDNRA,
      ROPN1L, C16orf61 and ZNF577 gene regions. The presented joint analyses from the
      two-stage study design were not significant after genome-wide correction. The
      SNPs identified in this study may serve as potential candidate loci for breast
      cancer risk in a further replication study in Stage III from Alberta population
      or independent validation in Caucasian cohorts elsewhere.

TI  - Novel breast cancer susceptibility locus at 9q31.2: results of a genome-wide
      association study.
PG  - 425-35
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djq563 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified several common
      genetic variants associated with breast cancer risk. It is likely, however, that 
      a substantial proportion of such loci have not yet been discovered. METHODS: We
      compared 296,114 tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 1694 breast cancer
      case subjects (92% with two primary cancers or at least two affected first-degree
      relatives) and 2365 control subjects, with validation in three independent series
      totaling 11,880 case subjects and 12,487 control subjects. Odds ratios (ORs) and 
      associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in each stage and all stages combined
      were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. Heterogeneity was
      evaluated with Cochran Q and I(2) statistics. All statistical tests were
      two-sided. RESULTS: We identified a novel risk locus for breast cancer at 9q31.2 
      (rs865686: OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.85 to 0.92, P = 1.75 x 10(-10)). This
      single-nucleotide polymorphism maps to a gene desert, the nearest genes being
      Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4, 636 kb centromeric), RAD23 homolog B (RAD23B, 794 kb
      centromeric), and actin-like 7A (ACTL7A, 736 kb telomeric). We also identified
      two variants (rs3734805 and rs9383938) mapping to 6q25.1 estrogen receptor 1
      (ESR1), which were associated with breast cancer in subjects of northern European
      ancestry (rs3734805: OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.27, P = 1.35 x 10(-7);
      rs9383938: OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.26, P = 1.41 x 10(-7)). A variant
      mapping to 10q26.13, approximately 300 kb telomeric to the established risk locus
      within the second intron of FGFR2, was also associated with breast cancer risk,
      although not at genome-wide statistical significance (rs10510102: OR = 1.12, 95% 
      CI = 1.07 to 1.17, P = 1.58 x 10(-6)). CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide
      further evidence on the role of genetic variation in the etiology of breast
      cancer. Fine mapping will be needed to identify causal variants and to determine 
      their functional effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a multifactorial disease with both
      environmental and genetic factors contributing to its development. The incidence 
      of CRC is increasing year by year in Japan. Patients with CRC in advanced stages 
      have a poor prognosis, but detection of CRC at earlier stages can improve
      clinical outcome. Therefore, identification of epidemiologial factors that
      influence development of CRC would facilitate the prevention or early detection
      of disease. METHODS: To identify loci associated with CRC risk, we performed a
      genome-wide association study (GWAS) for CRC and sub-analyses by tumour location 
      using 1583 Japanese CRC cases and 1898 controls. Subsequently, we conducted
      replication analyses using a total of 4809 CRC cases and 2973 controls including 
      225 Korean subjects with distal colon cancer and 377 controls. RESULTS: We
      identified a novel locus on 6q26-q27 region (rs7758229 in SLC22A3, p = 7.92 x
      10(-)(9), OR of 1.28) that was significantly associated with distal colon cancer.
      We also replicated the association between CRC and SNPs on 8q24 (rs6983267 and
      rs7837328, p = 1.51 x 10(-)(8) and 7.44 x 10(-)(8), ORs of 1.18 and 1.17,
      respectively). Moreover, we found cumulative effects of three genetic factors
      (rs7758229, rs6983267, and rs4939827 in SMAD7) and one environmental factor
      (alcohol drinking) which appear to increase CRC risk approximately twofold.
      CONCLUSIONS: We found a novel susceptible locus in SLC22A3 that contributes to
      the risk of distal colon cancer in an Asian population. These findings would
      further extend our understanding of the role of common genetic variants in the
      aetiology of CRC.

AB  - Although most patients with small-cell lung cancer respond to chemotherapy, the
      survival time is highly diverse. We conducted a genome-wide analysis to examine
      whether germline genetic variations are prognostic factors in small-cell lung
      cancer patients treated with the same chemotherapy regimen. Genome-wide scan of
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) was performed using blood DNA to identify
      genotypes associated with overall survival in 245 patients treated with
      platinum-based chemotherapy, and the results were replicated in another
      independent set of 305 patients. Associations were estimated by Cox models and
      function of the variants was examined by biochemical assays. We found that
      rs1820453 T>G SNP within the promoter region of YAP1 on chromosome 11q22 and
      rs716274 A>G SNP in the region of downstream of DYNC2H1 on chromosome 11q22.3 are
      associated with small-cell lung cancer survival. In pooled analysis of 2
      independent cohorts, the adjusted hazard ratio for patients with the rs1820453 TG
      or GG genotype was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.19-1.85; P = 0.0004) and 1.65 (95% CI,
      1.36-2.01; P = 4.76 x 10(-7)), respectively, compared with the TT genotype; and
      for patients with the rs716274 AG or GG genotype was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.47-2.29; P =
      8.74 x 10(-8)) and 2.96 (95% CI, 1.90-4.62; P = 1.59 x 10(-6)), respectively,
      compared with the AA genotype. Functional analysis showed that the rs1820453 T>G 
      change creates a transcriptional factor binding site and results in
      downregulation of YAP1 expression. These results suggest that YAP1 may play an
      important role in prognosis of small-cell lung cancer patients treated with
      platinum-based chemotherapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Our goal was to identify candidate polymorphisms that could influence
      overall survival (OS) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients
      treated with carboplatin (CBDCA) and paclitaxel (PTX). METHODS:
      Chemotherapy-naive stage IIIB or IV NSCLC patients treated with CBDCA (area under
      the curve = 6 mg/mL/min) and PTX (200 mg/m, 3-hour period) were eligible for this
      study. The DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      before treatment, and genotypes at approximately 110,000 gene-centric
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained by Illumina's Sentrix
      Human-1 Genotyping BeadChip. Statistical analyses were performed by the log-rank 
      test and Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: From July 2002 to May 2004, 105
      patients received a total of 308 cycles of treatment. The median survival time
      (MST) of 105 patients was 17.1 months. In the genome-wide association study,
      three SNPs were associated significantly with shortened OS after multiple
      comparison adjustment: rs1656402 in the EIF4E2 gene (MST was 18.0 and 7.7 months 
      for AG [n = 50] + AA [n = 40] and GG [n = 15], respectively; p = 8.4 x 10),
      rs1209950 in the ETS2 gene (MST = 17.7 and 7.4 months for CC [n = 94] and CT [n =
      11] + TT [n = 0]; p = 2.8 x 10), and rs9981861 in the DSCAM gene (MST = 17.1 and 
      3.8 months for AA [n = 75] + AG [n = 26] and GG [n = 4]; p = 3.5 x 10).
      CONCLUSION: Three SNPs were identified as new prognostic biomarker candidates for
      advanced NSCLC treated with CBDCA and PTX. The agnostic genome-wide association
      study may unveil unexplored molecular pathways associated with the drug response,
      but our findings should be replicated by other investigators.

TI  - Common genetic variants and modification of penetrance of BRCA2-associated breast
      cancer.
PG  - e1001183
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1001183 [doi]
AB  - The considerable uncertainty regarding cancer risks associated with inherited
      mutations of BRCA2 is due to unknown factors. To investigate whether common
      genetic variants modify penetrance for BRCA2 mutation carriers, we undertook a
      two-staged genome-wide association study in BRCA2 mutation carriers. In stage 1
      using the Affymetrix 6.0 platform, 592,163 filtered SNPs genotyped were available
      on 899 young (<40 years) affected and 804 unaffected carriers of European
      ancestry. Associations were evaluated using a survival-based score test adjusted 
      for familial correlations and stratified by country of the study and
      BRCA2*6174delT mutation status. The genomic inflation factor (lambda) was 1.011. 
      The stage 1 association analysis revealed multiple variants associated with
      breast cancer risk: 3 SNPs had p-values<10(-5) and 39 SNPs had p-values<10(-4).
      These variants included several previously associated with sporadic breast cancer
      risk and two novel loci on chromosome 20 (rs311499) and chromosome 10
      (rs16917302). The chromosome 10 locus was in ZNF365, which contains another
      variant that has recently been associated with breast cancer in an independent
      study of unselected cases. In stage 2, the top 85 loci from stage 1 were
      genotyped in 1,264 cases and 1,222 controls. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95%
      confidence intervals (CI) for stage 1 and 2 were combined and estimated using a
      retrospective likelihood approach, stratified by country of residence and the
      most common mutation, BRCA2*6174delT. The combined per allele HR of the minor
      allele for the novel loci rs16917302 was 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.86, ) and for
      rs311499 was 0.72 (95% CI 0.61-0.85, ). FGFR2 rs2981575 had the strongest
      association with breast cancer risk (per allele HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39, ).
      These results indicate that SNPs that modify BRCA2 penetrance identified by an
      agnostic approach thus far are limited to variants that also modify risk of
      sporadic BRCA2 wild-type breast cancer.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ten loci harboring common 
      variants that influence risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). To enhance
      the power to identify additional CRC risk loci, we conducted a meta-analysis of
      three GWAS from the UK which included a total of 3,334 affected individuals
      (cases) and 4,628 controls followed by multiple validation analyses including a
      total of 18,095 cases and 20,197 controls. We identified associations at four new
      CRC risk loci: 1q41 (rs6691170, odds ratio (OR) = 1.06, P = 9.55 x 10(-)(1)(0)
      and rs6687758, OR = 1.09, P = 2.27 x 10(-)(9), 3q26.2 (rs10936599, OR = 0.93, P =
      3.39 x 10(-)(8)), 12q13.13 (rs11169552, OR = 0.92, P = 1.89 x 10(-)(1)(0) and
      rs7136702, OR = 1.06, P = 4.02 x 10(-)(8)) and 20q13.33 (rs4925386, OR = 0.93, P 
      = 1.89 x 10(-)(1)(0)). In addition to identifying new CRC risk loci, this
      analysis provides evidence that additional CRC-associated variants of similar
      effect size remain to be discovered.

AB  - We conducted a multi-stage, genome-wide association study of bladder cancer with 
      a primary scan of 591,637 SNPs in 3,532 affected individuals (cases) and 5,120
      controls of European descent from five studies followed by a replication
      strategy, which included 8,382 cases and 48,275 controls from 16 studies. In a
      combined analysis, we identified three new regions associated with bladder cancer
      on chromosomes 22q13.1, 19q12 and 2q37.1: rs1014971, (P = 8 x 10(-)(1)(2)) maps
      to a non-genic region of chromosome 22q13.1, rs8102137 (P = 2 x 10(-)(1)(1)) on
      19q12 maps to CCNE1 and rs11892031 (P = 1 x 10(-)(7)) maps to the UGT1A cluster
      on 2q37.1. We confirmed four previously identified genome-wide associations on
      chromosomes 3q28, 4p16.3, 8q24.21 and 8q24.3, validated previous candidate
      associations for the GSTM1 deletion (P = 4 x 10(-)(1)(1)) and a tag SNP for NAT2 
      acetylation status (P = 4 x 10(-)(1)(1)), and found interactions with smoking in 
      both regions. Our findings on common variants associated with bladder cancer risk
      should provide new insights into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis.

TI  - Genome-wide association study to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
      associated with the development of erectile dysfunction in African-American men
      after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
PG  - 1292-300
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2010.07.036 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with
      erectile dysfunction (ED) among African-American prostate cancer patients treated
      with external beam radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cohort of
      African-American prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiation
      therapy was observed for the development of ED by use of the five-item Sexual
      Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) questionnaire. Final analysis included 27 cases
      (post-treatment SHIM score </=7) and 52 control subjects (post-treatment SHIM
      score >/=16). A genome-wide association study was performed using approximately
      909,000 SNPs genotyped on Affymetrix 6.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
      RESULTS: We identified SNP rs2268363, located in the follicle-stimulating hormone
      receptor (FSHR) gene, as significantly associated with ED after correcting for
      multiple comparisons (unadjusted p = 5.46 x 10(-8), Bonferroni p = 0.028). We
      identified four additional SNPs that tended toward a significant association with
      an unadjusted p value < 10(-6). Inference of population substructure showed that 
      cases had a higher proportion of African ancestry than control subjects (77% vs. 
      60%, p = 0.005). A multivariate logistic regression model that incorporated
      estimated ancestry and four of the top-ranked SNPs was a more accurate classifier
      of ED than a model that included only clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS: To our
      knowledge, this is the first genome-wide association study to identify SNPs
      associated with adverse effects resulting from radiotherapy. It is important to
      note that the SNP that proved to be significantly associated with ED is located
      within a gene whose encoded product plays a role in male gonad development and
      function. Another key finding of this project is that the four SNPs most strongly
      associated with ED were specific to persons of African ancestry and would
      therefore not have been identified had a cohort of European ancestry been
      screened. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a genome-wide approach to
      investigate genetic predisposition to radiation injury.

AB  - Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and the major cause of cancer
      death, both in Korea and worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as
      the predominant histologic type. To identify genetic risk factors, we here
      conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a replication study in 1425 
      patients with NSCLC and 3011 controls from Korea. From the data for 2162
      participants analyzed using the Affymetrix Genome-wide Human SNP array 5.0K, 168 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for validation. In the
      second stage, we were able to genotype 168 SNPs in 804 patients and 1470 controls
      to confirm the results of the GWAS. In the meta-analysis, rs2131877 at the
      chromosome 3q29 region was the most significant biomarker of lung cancer
      susceptibility in Koreans (P = 2.43 x 10(-8)). Four markers that were located
      within the chromosome 3q29 region were also associated with lung cancer
      susceptibility (trend P < 1.2 x 10(-4)), along with markers on 5p15 that were
      previously reported in populations of European descent. This high-density
      large-scale GWAS carried out in the Korean population suggests that 3q29 is a
      novel susceptibility region associated with lung cancer susceptibility in
      Koreans.

TI  - A combined analysis of genome-wide association studies in breast cancer.
PG  - 717-27
LID - 10.1007/s10549-010-1172-9 [doi]
AB  - In an attempt to identify common disease susceptibility alleles for breast
      cancer, we performed a combined analysis of three genome-wide association studies
      (GWAS), involving 2,702 women of European ancestry with invasive breast cancer
      and 5,726 controls. Tests for association were performed for 285,984 SNPs.
      Evidence for association with SNPs in genes in specific pathways was assessed
      using a permutation-based approach. We confirmed associations with loci reported 
      by previous GWAS on 1p11.2, 2q35, 3p, 5p12, 8q24, 10q23.13, 14q24.1 and 16q. Six 
      SNPs with the strongest signals of association with breast cancer, and which have
      not been reported previously, were typed in two further studies; however, none of
      the associations could be confirmed. Suggestive evidence for an excess of
      associations was found for genes involved in the regulation of actin
      cytoskeleton, glycan degradation, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, circadian
      rhythm, hematopoietic cell lineage and drug metabolism. Androgen and oestrogen
      metabolism, a pathway previously found to be associated with the development of
      postmenopausal breast cancer, was marginally significant (P = 0.051
      [unadjusted]). These results suggest that further analysis of SNPs in these
      pathways may identify associations that would be difficult to detect through
      agnostic single SNP analyses. More effort focused in these aspects of oncology
      can potentially open up promising avenues for the understanding of breast cancer 
      and its prevention.

TI  - Common variants at 19p13 are associated with susceptibility to ovarian cancer.
PG  - 880-4
LID - 10.1038/ng.666 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death from gynecological 
      malignancy in the developed world, accounting for 4% of the deaths from cancer in
      women. We performed a three-phase genome-wide association study of EOC survival
      in 8,951 individuals with EOC (cases) with available survival time data and a
      parallel association analysis of EOC susceptibility. Two SNPs at 19p13.11, rs8170
      and rs2363956, showed evidence of association with survival (overall P = 5 x
      10(-)(4) and P = 6 x 10(-)(4), respectively), but they did not replicate in phase
      3. However, the same two SNPs demonstrated genome-wide significance for risk of
      serous EOC (P = 3 x 10(-)(9) and P = 4 x 10(-)(1)(1), respectively). Expression
      analysis of candidate genes at this locus in ovarian tumors supported a role for 
      the BRCA1-interacting gene C19orf62, also known as MERIT40, which contains
      rs8170, in EOC development.

TI  - A genome-wide association study identifies susceptibility loci for ovarian cancer
      at 2q31 and 8q24.
PG  - 874-9

AB  - Ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than all other gynecological cancers
      combined. To identify common low-penetrance ovarian cancer susceptibility genes, 
      we conducted a genome-wide association study of 507,094 SNPs in 1,768 individuals
      with ovarian cancer (cases) and 2,354 controls, with follow up of 21,955 SNPs in 
      4,162 cases and 4,810 controls, leading to the identification of a confirmed
      susceptibility locus at 9p22 (in BNC2). Here, we report on nine additional
      candidate loci (defined as having P </= 10(-)(4)) identified after stratifying
      cases by histology, which we genotyped in an additional 4,353 cases and 6,021
      controls. We confirmed two new susceptibility loci with P </= 5 x 10(-)(8) (8q24,
      P = 8.0 x 10(-)(1)(5) and 2q31, P = 3.8 x 10(-)(1)(4)) and identified two
      additional loci that approached genome-wide significance (3q25, P = 7.1 x
      10(-)(8) and 17q21, P = 1.4 x 10(-)(7)). The associations of these loci with
      serous ovarian cancer were generally stronger than with other cancer subtypes.
      Analysis of HOXD1, MYC, TIPARP and SKAP1 at these loci and of BNC2 at 9p22
      supports a functional role for these genes in ovarian cancer development.

TI  - A locus on 19p13 modifies risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers and is
      associated with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer in the general
      population.
PG  - 885-92
LID - 10.1038/ng.669 [doi]
AB  - Germline BRCA1 mutations predispose to breast cancer. To identify genetic
      modifiers of this risk, we performed a genome-wide association study in 1,193
      individuals with BRCA1 mutations who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer
      under age 40 and 1,190 BRCA1 carriers without breast cancer diagnosis over age
      35. We took forward 96 SNPs for replication in another 5,986 BRCA1 carriers
      (2,974 individuals with breast cancer and 3,012 unaffected individuals). Five
      SNPs on 19p13 were associated with breast cancer risk (P(trend) = 2.3 x 10(-)(9) 
      to P(trend) = 3.9 x 10(-)(7)), two of which showed independent associations
      (rs8170, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.35; rs2363956 HR = 0.84, 95% CI 
      0.80-0.89). Genotyping these SNPs in 6,800 population-based breast cancer cases
      and 6,613 controls identified a similar association with estrogen
      receptor-negative breast cancer (rs2363956 per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 0.83, 95%
      CI 0.75-0.92, P(trend) = 0.0003) and an association with estrogen
      receptor-positive disease in the opposite direction (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14,
      P(trend) = 0.016). The five SNPs were also associated with triple-negative breast
      cancer in a separate study of 2,301 triple-negative cases and 3,949 controls
      (P(trend) = 1 x 10(-)(7)) to P(trend) = 8 x 10(-)(5); rs2363956 per-allele OR =
      0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.87, P(trend) = 1.1 x 10(-)(7)

AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study of gastric cancer and esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in ethnic Chinese subjects in which we genotyped
      551,152 SNPs. We report a combined analysis of 2,240 gastric cancer cases, 2,115 
      ESCC cases and 3,302 controls drawn from five studies. In logistic regression
      models adjusted for age, sex and study, multiple variants at 10q23 had
      genome-wide significance for gastric cancer and ESCC independently. A notable
      signal was rs2274223, a nonsynonymous SNP located in PLCE1, for gastric cancer (P
      = 8.40 x 10(-9); per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 1.31) and ESCC (P = 3.85 x 10(-9); 
      OR = 1.34). The association with gastric cancer differed by anatomic subsite. For
      tumors in the cardia the association was stronger (P = 4.19 x 10(-15); OR =
      1.57), and for those in the noncardia stomach it was absent (P = 0.44; OR =
      1.05). Our findings at 10q23 could provide insight into the high incidence of
      both cancers in China.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of pancreatic cancer in Japanese population.
PG  - e11824
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0011824 [doi]
AB  - Pancreatic cancer shows very poor prognosis and is the fifth leading cause of
      cancer death in Japan. Previous studies indicated some genetic factors
      contributing to the development and progression of pancreatic cancer; however,
      there are limited reports for common genetic variants to be associated with this 
      disease, especially in the Asian population. We have conducted a genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) using 991 invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
      cases and 5,209 controls, and identified three loci showing significant
      association (P-value<5x10(-7)) with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. The SNPs
      that showed significant association carried estimated odds ratios of 1.29, 1.32, 
      and 3.73 with 95% confidence intervals of 1.17-1.43, 1.19-1.47, and 2.24-6.21;
      P-value of 3.30x10(-7), 3.30x10(-7), and 4.41x10(-7); located on chromosomes
      6p25.3, 12p11.21 and 7q36.2, respectively. These associated SNPs are located
      within linkage disequilibrium blocks containing genes that have been implicated
      some roles in the oncogenesis of pancreatic cancer.

      prostate cancer in the Japanese population.
PG  - 751-4
LID - 10.1038/ng.635 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in males throughout the
      world, and its incidence is increasing in Asian countries. We carried out a
      genome-wide association study and replication study using 4,584 Japanese men with
      prostate cancer and 8,801 control subjects. From the thirty-one associated SNPs
      reported in previous genome-wide association studies in European populations, we 
      confirmed the association of nine SNPs at P < 1.0 x 10(-7) and ten SNPs at P <
      0.05 in the Japanese population. The remaining 12 SNPs showed no association (P >
      0.05). In addition, we report here five new loci for prostate cancer
      susceptibility, at 5p15 (lambda-corrected probability P(GC) = 3.9 x 10(-18)),
      GPRC6A/RFX6 (P(GC) = 1.6 x 10(-12)), 13q22 (P(GC) = 2.8 x 10(-9)), C2orf43 (P(GC)
      = 7.5 x 10(-8)) and FOXP4 (P(GC) = 7.6 x 10(-8)). These findings advance our
      understanding of the genetic basis of prostate carcinogenesis and also highlight 
      the genetic heterogeneity of prostate cancer susceptibility among different
      ethnic populations.

AB  - Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. We
      carried out a multi-stage genome-wide association (GWA) study in over 28,000
      cases and controls recruited from 12 studies conducted in Asian and European
      American women to identify genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. After
      analyzing 684,457 SNPs in 2,073 cases and 2,084 controls in Chinese women, we
      evaluated 53 SNPs for fast-track replication in an independent set of 4,425 cases
      and 1,915 controls of Chinese origin. Four replicated SNPs were further
      investigated in an independent set of 6,173 cases and 6,340 controls from seven
      other studies conducted in Asian women. SNP rs4784227 was consistently associated
      with breast cancer risk across all studies with adjusted odds ratios (95%
      confidence intervals) of 1.25 (1.20-1.31) per allele (P = 3.2 x 10(-25)) in the
      pooled analysis of samples from all Asian samples. This SNP was also associated
      with breast cancer risk among European Americans (per allele OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 
      1.09-1.31, P = 1.3 x 10(-4), 2,797 cases and 2,662 controls). SNP rs4784227 is
      located at 16q12.1, a region identified previously for breast cancer risk among
      Europeans. The association of this SNP with breast cancer risk remained highly
      statistically significant in Asians after adjusting for previously-reported SNPs 
      in this region. In vitro experiments using both luciferase reporter and
      electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated functional significance of
      this SNP. These results provide strong evidence implicating rs4784227 as a
      functional causal variant for breast cancer in the locus 16q12.1 and demonstrate 
      the utility of conducting genetic association studies in populations with
      different genetic architectures.

AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study for testicular germ cell tumor,
      genotyping 298,782 SNPs in 979 affected individuals and 4,947 controls from the
      UK and replicating associations in a further 664 cases and 3,456 controls. We
      identified three new susceptibility loci, two of which include genes that are
      involved in telomere regulation. We identified two independent signals within the
      TERT-CLPTM1L locus on chromosome 5, which has previously been associated with
      multiple other cancers (rs4635969, OR=1.54, P=1.14x10(-23); rs2736100, OR=1.33,
      P=7.55x10(-15)). We also identified a locus on chromosome 12 (rs2900333, OR=1.27,
      P=6.16x10(-10)) that contains ATF7IP, a regulator of TERT expression. Finally, we
      identified a locus on chromosome 9 (rs755383, OR=1.37, P=1.12x10(-23)),
      containing the sex determination gene DMRT1, which has been linked to teratoma
      susceptibility in mice.

PG  - 504-7

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in developed countries. To
      identify common breast cancer susceptibility alleles, we conducted a genome-wide 
      association study in which 582,886 SNPs were genotyped in 3,659 cases with a
      family history of the disease and 4,897 controls. Promising associations were
      evaluated in a second stage, comprising 12,576 cases and 12,223 controls. We
      identified five new susceptibility loci, on chromosomes 9, 10 and 11 (P = 4.6 x
      10(-7) to P = 3.2 x 10(-15)). We also identified SNPs in the 6q25.1 (rs3757318, P
      = 2.9 x 10(-6)), 8q24 (rs1562430, P = 5.8 x 10(-7)) and LSP1 (rs909116, P = 7.3 x
      10(-7)) regions that showed more significant association with risk than those
      reported previously. Previously identified breast cancer susceptibility loci were
      also found to show larger effect sizes in this study of familial breast cancer
      cases than in previous population-based studies, consistent with polygenic
      susceptibility to the disease.

AB  - Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) among individuals exposed to radioactive iodine in
      their childhood or adolescence is a major internationally recognized health
      consequence of the Chernobyl accident. To identify genetic determinants affecting
      individual susceptibility to radiation-related PTC, we conducted a genome-wide
      association study employing Belarusian patients with PTC aged 0-18 years at the
      time of accident and age-matched Belarusian control subjects. Two series of
      genome scans were performed using independent sample sets, and association with
      radiation-related PTC was evaluated. Meta-analysis by the Mantel-Haenszel method 
      combining the two studies identified four SNPs at chromosome 9q22.33 showing
      significant associations with the disease (Mantel-Haenszel P: mhp = 1.7 x 10(-9) 
      to 4.9 x 10(-9)). The association was further reinforced by a validation analysis
      using one of these SNP markers, rs965513, with a new set of samples (overall mhp 
      = 4.8 x 10(-12), OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.43-1.91). Rs965513 is located 57-kb
      upstream to FOXE1, a thyroid-specific transcription factor with pivotal roles in 
      thyroid morphogenesis and was recently reported as the strongest genetic risk
      marker of sporadic PTC in European populations. Of interest, no association was
      obtained between radiation-related PTC and rs944289 (mhp = 0.17) at 14p13.3 which
      showed the second strongest association with sporadic PTC in Europeans. These
      results show that the complex pathway underlying the pathogenesis may be partly
      shared by the two etiological forms of PTC, but their genetic components do not
      completely overlap each other, suggesting the presence of other unknown
      etiology-specific genetic determinants in radiation-related PTC.

AB  - Previously, we reported germline DNA variants associated with risk of urinary
      bladder cancer (UBC) in Dutch and Icelandic subjects. Here we expanded the
      Icelandic sample set and tested the top 20 markers from the combined analysis in 
      several European case-control sample sets, with a total of 4,739 cases and 45,549
      controls. The T allele of rs798766 on 4p16.3 was found to associate with UBC
      (odds ratio = 1.24, P = 9.9 x 10(-12)). rs798766 is located in an intron of
      TACC3, 70 kb from FGFR3, which often harbors activating somatic mutations in
      low-grade, noninvasive UBC. Notably, rs798766[T] shows stronger association with 
      low-grade and low-stage UBC than with more aggressive forms of the disease and is
      associated with higher risk of recurrence in low-grade stage Ta tumors. The
      frequency of rs798766[T] is higher in Ta tumors that carry an activating mutation
      in FGFR3 than in Ta tumors with wild-type FGFR3. Our results show a link between 
      germline variants, somatic mutations of FGFR3 and risk of UBC.

TI  - Genetic variants and risk of lung cancer in never smokers: a genome-wide
      association study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked tobacco products is 
      an increasing medical and public-health issue. We aimed to unravel the genetic
      basis of lung cancer in never smokers. METHODS: We did a four-stage
      investigation. First, a genome-wide association study of single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) was done with 754 never smokers (377 matched case-control
      pairs at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA). Second, the top candidate SNPs from
      the first study were validated in two independent studies among 735 (MD Anderson 
      Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA) and 253 (Harvard University, Boston, MA, USA)
      never smokers. Third, further replication of the top SNP was done in 530 never
      smokers (UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Fourth, expression quantitative trait loci 
      (eQTL) and gene-expression differences were analysed to further elucidate the
      causal relation between the validated SNPs and the risk of lung cancer in never
      smokers. FINDINGS: 44 top candidate SNPs were identified that might alter the
      risk of lung cancer in never smokers. rs2352028 at chromosome 13q31.3 was
      subsequently replicated with an additive genetic model in the four independent
      studies, with a combined odds ratio of 1.46 (95% CI 1.26-1.70, p=5.94x10(-6)). A 
      cis eQTL analysis showed there was a strong correlation between genotypes of the 
      replicated SNPs and the transcription level of the gene GPC5 in normal lung
      tissues (p=1.96x10(-4)), with the high-risk allele linked with lower expression. 
      Additionally, the transcription level of GPC5 in normal lung tissue was twice
      that detected in matched lung adenocarcinoma tissue (p=6.75x10(-11)).
      INTERPRETATION: Genetic variants at 13q31.3 alter the expression of GPC5, and are
      associated with susceptibility to lung cancer in never smokers. Downregulation of
      GPC5 might contribute to the development of lung cancer in never smokers.

AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study of pancreatic cancer in 3,851
      affected individuals (cases) and 3,934 unaffected controls drawn from 12
      prospective cohort studies and 8 case-control studies. Based on a logistic
      regression model for genotype trend effect that was adjusted for study, age, sex,
      self-described ancestry and five principal components, we identified eight SNPs
      that map to three loci on chromosomes 13q22.1, 1q32.1 and 5p15.33. Two correlated
      SNPs, rs9543325 (P = 3.27 x 10(-11), per-allele odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% CI
      1.18-1.35) and rs9564966 (P = 5.86 x 10(-8), per-allele OR 1.21, 95% CI
      1.13-1.30), map to a nongenic region on chromosome 13q22.1. Five SNPs on 1q32.1
      map to NR5A2, and the strongest signal was at rs3790844 (P = 2.45 x 10(-10),
      per-allele OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.84). A single SNP, rs401681 (P = 3.66 x 10(-7),
      per-allele OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11-1.27), maps to the CLPTM1L-TERT locus on 5p15.33,
      which is associated with multiple cancers. Our study has identified common
      susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer that warrant follow-up studies.

      P = 6.2 x 10(-15)) and rs445114[T] (OR = 1.14, P = 4.7 x 10(-10)), on 8q24.21;
      and rs8102476[C] (OR = 1.12, P = 1.6 x 10(-11)) on 19q13.2. We also refined a
      previous association signal on 11q13 with the SNP rs11228565[A] (OR = 1.23, P =
      6.7 x 10(-12)). In a multivariate analysis using 22 prostate cancer risk variants
      typed in the Icelandic population, we estimated that carriers in the top 1.3% of 
      the risk distribution are at a 2.5 times greater risk of developing the disease
      than members of the general population.

PG  - 1116-21
LID - 10.1038/ng.450 [doi]
AB  - Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in males in
      developed countries. To identify common PrCa susceptibility alleles, we
      previously conducted a genome-wide association study in which 541,129 SNPs were
      genotyped in 1,854 PrCa cases with clinically detected disease and in 1,894
      controls. We have now extended the study to evaluate promising associations in a 
      second stage in which we genotyped 43,671 SNPs in 3,650 PrCa cases and 3,940
      controls and in a third stage involving an additional 16,229 cases and 14,821
      controls from 21 studies. In addition to replicating previous associations, we
      identified seven new prostate cancer susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2, 4, 8, 
      11 and 22 (with P = 1.6 x 10(-8) to P = 2.7 x 10(-33)).

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is prevalent among
      Asian populations, with marked regional variations in incidence and mortality.
      Patients with ESCC have a very poor prognosis, but detection of ESCC at earlier
      stages could improve clinical outcome. Therefore, identification of epidemiologic
      factors that influence the development of ESCC would facilitate prevention and/or
      early detection of the disease. METHODS: We performed a 2-step genome-wide
      association study with subsequent replication analysis using a total of 1070
      Japanese ESCC cases and 2836 controls. We also used logistic regression analysis 
      to estimate the effect of gene-gene and gene-environmental interactions. RESULTS:
      We identified the significant associations of ESCC with 4q21-23 and 12q24
      regions, which include nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in
      ADH1B (rs1229984, P = 6.76 x 10(-35)) and ALDH2 (rs671, P = 3.68 x 10(-68)) that 
      were previously shown to be associated with ESCC susceptibility. Multiple
      logistic regression analysis revealed SNP rs671, rs1229984, alcohol drinking, and
      smoking as the independent risk factors for ESCC (odds ratios of 1.66, 1.85,
      1.92, and 1.79, respectively). Moreover, individuals who had both genetic and
      lifestyle-related risk factors had a nearly 190 times higher risk of ESCC than
      those who had neither of these. CONCLUSIONS: We found 2 known functional variants
      involved in the metabolism of alcohol and tobacco by-products as the most
      significant risk factors for the development of ESCC in a Japanese population.
      The individuals carrying both risk genotypes have a higher baseline risk of ESCC 
      that is substantially increased by 2 lifestyle risk factors.

LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-09-0680 [doi]
AB  - To explore the impact of common variation on the risk of developing lung cancer, 
      we conducted a two-phase genome-wide association (GWA) study. In phase 1, we
      compared the genotypes of 511,919 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
      in 1,952 cases and 1,438 controls; in phase 2, 30,568 SNPs were genotyped in
      2,465 cases and 3,005 controls. SNP selection was based on best supported P
      values from phase 1 and two other GWA studies of lung cancer. In the combined
      analysis of phases 1 and 2, the strongest associations identified were defined by
      SNPs mapping to 15q25.1 (rs12914385; P = 3.19 x 10(-16)), 5p15.33 (rs4975616; P =
      6.66 x 10(-7)), and 6p21.33 (rs3117582; P = 9.13 x 10(-7)). Variation at 15q25.1,
      but not 5p15.33 or 6p21.33, was strongly associated with smoking behavior with
      risk alleles correlated to higher consumption. Variation at 5p15.33 was shown to 
      significantly influence induction of lung cancer histology. Pooling data from the
      four series provided 21,620 genotypes for 7,560 cases and 8,205 controls. A
      meta-analysis provided increased support that variation at 15q25.1 (rs8034191; P 
      = 3.24 x 10(-26)), 5p15.33 (rs4975616; P = 2.99 x 10(-9)), and 6p21.33
      (rs3117582; P = 4.46 x 10(-10)) influences lung cancer risk. The next
      best-supported associations were attained at 15q15.2 (rs748404: P = 1.08 x
      10(-6)) and 10q23.31 (rs1926203; P = 1.28 x 10(-6)). These data indicate few
      common variants account for 1% of the excess familial risk underscoring the
      necessity of having additional large sample series for gene discovery.

PG  - 991-5
LID - 10.1038/ng.421 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study on 969 bladder cancer cases and 957 
      controls from Texas. For fast-track validation, we evaluated 60 SNPs in three
      additional US populations and validated the top SNP in nine European populations.
      A missense variant (rs2294008) in the PSCA gene showed consistent association
      with bladder cancer in US and European populations. Combining all subjects (6,667
      cases, 39,590 controls), the overall P-value was 2.14 x 10(-10) and the allelic
      odds ratio was 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.10-1.20). rs2294008 alters the
      start codon and is predicted to cause truncation of nine amino acids from the
      N-terminal signal sequence of the primary PSCA translation product. In vitro
      reporter gene assay showed that the variant allele significantly reduced promoter
      activity. Resequencing of the PSCA genomic region showed that rs2294008 is the
      only common missense SNP in PSCA. Our data identify rs2294008 as a new bladder
      cancer susceptibility locus.

AB  - Epithelial ovarian cancer has a major heritable component, but the known
      susceptibility genes explain less than half the excess familial risk. We
      performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify common ovarian
      cancer susceptibility alleles. We evaluated 507,094 SNPs genotyped in 1,817 cases
      and 2,353 controls from the UK and approximately 2 million imputed SNPs. We
      genotyped the 22,790 top ranked SNPs in 4,274 cases and 4,809 controls of
      European ancestry from Europe, USA and Australia. We identified 12 SNPs at 9p22
      associated with disease risk (P < 10(-8)). The most significant SNP (rs3814113; P
      = 2.5 x 10(-17)) was genotyped in a further 2,670 ovarian cancer cases and 4,668 
      controls, confirming its association (combined data odds ratio (OR) = 0.82, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) 0.79-0.86, P(trend) = 5.1 x 10(-19)). The association
      differs by histological subtype, being strongest for serous ovarian cancers (OR
      0.77, 95% CI 0.73-0.81, P(trend) = 4.1 x 10(-21)).

AB  - We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of pancreatic cancer, a
      cancer with one of the lowest survival rates worldwide. We genotyped 558,542 SNPs
      in 1,896 individuals with pancreatic cancer and 1,939 controls drawn from 12
      prospective cohorts plus one hospital-based case-control study. We conducted a
      combined analysis of these groups plus an additional 2,457 affected individuals
      and 2,654 controls from eight case-control studies, adjusting for study, sex,
      ancestry and five principal components. We identified an association between a
      locus on 9q34 and pancreatic cancer marked by the SNP rs505922 (combined P = 5.37
      x 10(-8); multiplicative per-allele odds ratio 1.20; 95% confidence interval
      1.12-1.28). This SNP maps to the first intron of the ABO blood group gene. Our
      results are consistent with earlier epidemiologic evidence suggesting that people
      with blood group O may have a lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those with
      groups A or B.

TI  - Common variation in KITLG and at 5q31.3 predisposes to testicular germ cell
      cancer.
PG  - 811-5
LID - 10.1038/ng.393 [doi]
AB  - Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) have been expected to have a strong underlying
      genetic component. We conducted a genome-wide scan among 277 TGCT cases and 919
      controls and found that seven markers at 12p22 within KITLG (c-KIT ligand)
      reached genome-wide significance (P < 5.0 x 10(-8) in discovery). In independent 
      replication, TGCT risk was increased threefold per copy of the major allele at
      rs3782179 and rs4474514 (OR = 3.08, 95% CI = 2.29-4.13; OR = 3.07, 95% CI =
      2.29-4.13, respectively). We found associations with rs4324715 and rs6897876 at
      5q31.3 near SPRY4 (sprouty 4; P < 5.0 x 10(-6) in discovery). In independent
      replication, risk of TGCT was increased nearly 40% per copy of the major allele
      (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14-1.64; OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.16-1.66, respectively). All
      of the genotypes were associated with both seminoma and nonseminoma TGCT
      subtypes. These results demonstrate that common genetic variants affect TGCT risk
      and implicate KITLG and SPRY4 as genes involved in TGCT susceptibility.

AB  - We conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of breast cancer 
      in 9,770 cases and 10,799 controls in the Cancer Genetic Markers of
      Susceptibility (CGEMS) initiative. In stage 1, we genotyped 528,173 SNPs in 1,145
      cases of invasive breast cancer and 1,142 controls. In stage 2, we analyzed
      24,909 top SNPs in 4,547 cases and 4,434 controls. In stage 3, we investigated 21
      loci in 4,078 cases and 5,223 controls. Two new loci achieved genome-wide
      significance. A pericentromeric SNP on chromosome 1p11.2 (rs11249433; P = 6.74 x 
      10(-10) adjusted genotype test, 2 degrees of freedom) resides in a large linkage 
      disequilibrium block neighboring NOTCH2 and FCGR1B; this signal was stronger for 
      estrogen-receptor-positive tumors. A second SNP on chromosome 14q24.1 (rs999737; 
      P = 1.74 x 10(-7)) localizes to RAD51L1, a gene in the homologous recombination
      DNA repair pathway. We also confirmed associations with loci on chromosomes 2q35,
      5p12, 5q11.2, 8q24, 10q26 and 16q12.1.

TI  - Newly discovered breast cancer susceptibility loci on 3p24 and 17q23.2.
PG  - 585-90

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified seven breast cancer
      susceptibility loci, but these explain only a small fraction of the familial risk
      of the disease. Five of these loci were identified through a two-stage GWAS
      involving 390 familial cases and 364 controls in the first stage, and 3,990 cases
      and 3,916 controls in the second stage. To identify additional loci, we tested
      over 800 promising associations from this GWAS in a further two stages involving 
      37,012 cases and 40,069 controls from 33 studies in the CGEMS collaboration and
      Breast Cancer Association Consortium. We found strong evidence for additional
      susceptibility loci on 3p (rs4973768: per-allele OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.08-1.13, P
      = 4.1 x 10(-23)) and 17q (rs6504950: per-allele OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.92-0.97, P 
      = 1.4 x 10(-8)). Potential causative genes include SLC4A7 and NEK10 on 3p and
      COX11 on 17q.

AB  - We carried out a genome-wide association study among Chinese women to identify
      risk variants for breast cancer. After analyzing 607,728 SNPs in 1,505 cases and 
      1,522 controls, we selected 29 SNPs for a fast-track replication in an
      independent set of 1,554 cases and 1,576 controls. We further investigated four
      replicated loci in a third set of samples comprising 3,472 cases and 900
      controls. SNP rs2046210 at 6q25.1, located upstream of the gene encoding estrogen
      receptor alpha (ESR1), showed strong and consistent association with breast
      cancer across all three stages. Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) were 1.36
      (1.24-1.49) and 1.59 (1.40-1.82), respectively, for genotypes A/G and A/A versus 
      G/G (P for trend 2.0 x 10(-15)) in the pooled analysis of samples from all three 
      stages. We also found a similar, albeit weaker, association in an independent
      study comprising 1,591 cases and 1,466 controls of European ancestry (P(trend) = 
      0.01). These results strongly implicate 6q25.1 as a susceptibility locus for
      breast cancer.

TI  - Common variants on 9q22.33 and 14q13.3 predispose to thyroid cancer in European
      populations.
PG  - 460-4
LID - 10.1038/ng.339 [doi]
AB  - In order to search for sequence variants conferring risk of thyroid cancer we
      conducted a genome-wide association study in 192 and 37,196 Icelandic cases and
      controls, respectively, followed by a replication study in individuals of
      European descent. Here we show that two common variants, located on 9q22.33 and
      14q13.3, are associated with the disease. Overall, the strongest association
      signals were observed for rs965513 on 9q22.33 (OR = 1.75; P = 1.7 x 10(-27)) and 
      rs944289 on 14q13.3 (OR = 1.37; P = 2.0 x 10(-9)). The gene nearest to the
      9q22.33 locus is FOXE1 (TTF2) and NKX2-1 (TTF1) is among the genes located at the
      14q13.3 locus. Both variants contribute to an increased risk of both papillary
      and follicular thyroid cancer. Approximately 3.7% of individuals are homozygous
      for both variants, and their estimated risk of thyroid cancer is 5.7-fold greater
      than that of noncarriers. In a study on a large sample set from the general
      population, both risk alleles are associated with low concentrations of thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH), and the 9q22.33 allele is associated with low
      concentration of thyroxin (T(4)) and high concentration of triiodothyronine
      (T(3)).

PG  - 10-5
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3464 [doi]
AB  - To search for genetic variants that are associated with prostate cancer risk in
      the genome, we combined the data from our genome-wide association study (GWAS) in
      a population-based case-control study in Sweden with publicly available GWAS data
      from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) study. We limited the
      cases to those with aggressive disease in an attempt to identify risk variants
      that are associated with this most clinically relevant form of the disease. Among
      the most likely candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) identified from
      the two GWAS, we sequentially confirmed one SNP at 22q13 in two independent study
      populations: the remaining subjects in Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden and a
      hospital-based case-control study at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Association of
      aggressive prostate cancer with the SNP at 22q13 was also observed in the
      publicly available data of four additional study populations from the second
      stage of the CGEMS study. In all seven study populations examined, the frequency 
      of allele "C" of rs9623117 at 22q13 was consistently higher in aggressive cases
      than in controls. The combined allelic test was highly significant, with P = 5.0 
      x 10(-7). The odds ratio (OR) of allele C for aggressive prostate cancer was
      estimated to be 1.18 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.11-1.26]. However, the 
      SNP was also associated with nonaggressive prostate cancer, with an estimated OR 
      of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.04-1.19; P = 0.004). The risk-associated variants are located 
      within the genomic region of TNRC6B, a gene involved in miRNA-mediated mRNA
      degradation. Additional studies are warranted to further confirm the association.

LID - 10.1038/ng.262 [doi]
AB  - Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified multiple loci at which
      common variants modestly influence the risk of developing colorectal cancer
      (CRC). To enhance power to identify additional loci with similar effect sizes, we
      conducted a meta-analysis of two GWA studies, comprising 13,315 individuals
      genotyped for 38,710 common tagging SNPs. We undertook replication testing in up 
      to eight independent case-control series comprising 27,418 subjects. We
      identified four previously unreported CRC risk loci at 14q22.2 (rs4444235, BMP4; 
      P = 8.1 x 10(-10)), 16q22.1 (rs9929218, CDH1; P = 1.2 x 10(-8)), 19q13.1
      (rs10411210, RHPN2; P = 4.6 x 10(-9)) and 20p12.3 (rs961253; P = 2.0 x 10(-10)). 
      These findings underscore the value of large sample series for discovery and
      follow-up of genetic variants contributing to the etiology of CRC.

AB  - We carried out a genome-wide association study of lung cancer (3,259 cases and
      4,159 controls), followed by replication in 2,899 cases and 5,573 controls. Two
      uncorrelated disease markers at 5p15.33, rs402710 and rs2736100 were detected by 
      the genome-wide data (P = 2 x 10(-7) and P = 4 x 10(-6)) and replicated by the
      independent study series (P = 7 x 10(-5) and P = 0.016). The susceptibility
      region contains two genes, TERT and CLPTM1L, suggesting that one or both may have
      a role in lung cancer etiology.

AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) study of lung cancer comparing
      511,919 SNP genotypes in 1,952 cases and 1,438 controls. The most significant
      association was attained at 15q25.1 (rs8042374; P = 7.75 x 10(-12)), confirming
      recent observations. Pooling data with two other GWA studies (5,095 cases, 5,200 
      controls) and with replication in an additional 2,484 cases and 3,036 controls,
      we identified two newly associated risk loci mapping to 6p21.33 (rs3117582,
      BAT3-MSH5; P(combined) = 4.97 x 10(-10)) and 5p15.33 (rs401681, CLPTM1L;

TI  - Sequence variant on 8q24 confers susceptibility to urinary bladder cancer.
PG  - 1307-12
LID - 10.1038/ng.229 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a genome-wide SNP association study on 1,803 urinary bladder cancer 
      (UBC) cases and 34,336 controls from Iceland and The Netherlands and follow up
      studies in seven additional case-control groups (2,165 cases and 3,800 controls).
      The strongest association was observed with allele T of rs9642880 on chromosome
      8q24, 30 kb upstream of MYC (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 1.22; P = 9.34 x
      10(-12)). Approximately 20% of individuals of European ancestry are homozygous
      for rs9642880[T], and their estimated risk of developing UBC is 1.49 times that
      of noncarriers. No association was observed between UBC and the four 8q24
      variants previously associated with prostate, colorectal and breast cancers, nor 
      did rs9642880 associate with any of these three cancers. A weaker signal, but
      nonetheless of genome-wide significance, was captured by rs710521[A] located near
      TP63 on chromosome 3q28 (allele-specific OR = 1.19; P = 1. 15 x 10(-7)).

LID - 10.1093/jnci/djn268 [doi]
AB  - Three recent genome-wide association studies identified associations between
      markers in the chromosomal region 15q24-25.1 and the risk of lung cancer. We
      conducted a genome-wide association analysis to investigate associations between 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the risk of lung cancer, in which we
      used blood DNA from 194 case patients with familial lung cancer and 219
      cancer-free control subjects. We identified associations between common sequence 
      variants at 15q24-25.1 (that spanned LOC123688 [a hypothetical gene], PSMA4,
      CHRNA3, CHRNA5, and CHRNB4) and lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer was more
      than fivefold higher among those subjects who had both a family history of lung
      cancer and two copies of high-risk alleles rs8034191 (odds ratio [OR] = 7.20, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 2.21 to 23.37) or rs1051730 (OR = 5.67, CI = 2.21 to
      14.60, both of which were located in the 15q24-25.1 locus, than among control
      subjects. Thus, further research to elucidate causal variants in the 15q24-25.1
      locus that are associated with lung cancer is warranted.

AB  - High-density oligonucleotide microarrays containing a large number of single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have enabled genome-wide association (GWA)
      analysis to become a reality. We used the early access Affymetrix Mendel Nsp 250K
      chips in a GWA case-control pilot study to identify genomic regions associated
      with breast cancer. We included 30 randomly sampled incident invasive breast
      cancer cases aged <45 years without deleterious mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2
      genes, and 30 population controls individually matched on age, ethnicity and
      geographical area. The overall genotype call rate was 97.13+/-1.33% for controls 
      and 97.48+/-1.42% for cases. Comparison was made between cases and controls for
      203,477 genotyped SNPs using (a) unconditional logistic regression (ULR), (b)
      conditional logistic regression (CLR) models with adjustment for the matched
      pairs, (c) allelic tests for single marker tests and (d) haplotype trend
      regression (HTR). Genomic control and EIGENSTRAT methods were used for correction
      of population stratification in appropriate models. We demonstrate the similarity
      and dissimilarity of results from different statistical analyses. We found
      several possible significant regions harboring biologically meaningful known
      candidate genes, such as genes encoding fibroblast growth factor, transforming
      growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and estrogen synthesis enzymes to be
      associated with early-onset breast cancer. In single marker analysis, none of the
      SNPs were statistically significant after correction for multiple testing.
      However, haplotype association tests, using 90730 tag-SNPs, suggested two regions
      in GLG1 and UGT1 genes retaining significance even after Bonferroni correction.
      Nevertheless, without systematic replication, findings from this pilot study,
      especially the associations of breast cancer in relation to specific SNPs, should
      be interpreted with great caution.

TI  - A susceptibility locus for lung cancer maps to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
      subunit genes on 15q25.
PG  - 633-7
LID - 10.1038/nature06885 [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with over one
      million cases annually. To identify genetic factors that modify disease risk, we 
      conducted a genome-wide association study by analysing 317,139 single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms in 1,989 lung cancer cases and 2,625 controls from six central
      European countries. We identified a locus in chromosome region 15q25 that was
      strongly associated with lung cancer (P = 9 x 10(-10)). This locus was replicated
      in five separate lung cancer studies comprising an additional 2,513 lung cancer
      cases and 4,752 controls (P = 5 x 10(-20) overall), and it was found to account
      for 14% (attributable risk) of lung cancer cases. Statistically similar risks
      were observed irrespective of smoking status or propensity to smoke tobacco. The 
      association region contains several genes, including three that encode nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4). Such subunits are
      expressed in neurons and other tissues, in particular alveolar epithelial cells, 
      pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and lung cancer cell lines, and they bind to
      N'-nitrosonornicotine and potential lung carcinogens. A non-synonymous variant of
      CHRNA5 that induces an amino acid substitution (D398N) at a highly conserved site
      in the second intracellular loop of the protein is among the markers with the
      strongest disease associations. Our results provide compelling evidence of a
      locus at 15q25 predisposing to lung cancer, and reinforce interest in nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptors as potential disease candidates and chemopreventative
      targets.

TI  - Genome-wide association scan of tag SNPs identifies a susceptibility locus for
      lung cancer at 15q25.1.
PG  - 616-22
LID - 10.1038/ng.109 [doi]
AB  - To identify risk variants for lung cancer, we conducted a multistage genome-wide 
      association study. In the discovery phase, we analyzed 315,450 tagging SNPs in
      1,154 current and former (ever) smoking cases of European ancestry and 1,137
      frequency-matched, ever-smoking controls from Houston, Texas. For replication, we
      evaluated the ten SNPs most significantly associated with lung cancer in an
      additional 711 cases and 632 controls from Texas and 2,013 cases and 3,062
      controls from the UK. Two SNPs, rs1051730 and rs8034191, mapping to a region of
      strong linkage disequilibrium within 15q25.1 containing PSMA4 and the nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptor subunit genes CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, were significantly
      associated with risk in both replication sets. Combined analysis yielded odds
      ratios of 1.32 (P < 1 x 10(-17)) for both SNPs. Haplotype analysis was consistent
      with there being a single risk variant in this region. We conclude that variation
      in a region of 15q25.1 containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors genes
      contributes to lung cancer risk.

AB  - To identify colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility alleles, we conducted a
      genome-wide association study. In phase 1, we genotyped 550,163 tagSNPs in 940
      familial colorectal tumor cases (627 CRC, 313 high-risk adenoma) and 965
      controls. In phase 2, we genotyped 42,708 selected SNPs in 2,873 CRC cases and
      2,871 controls. In phase 3, we evaluated 11 SNPs showing association at P <
      10(-4) in a joint analysis of phases 1 and 2 in 4,287 CRC cases and 3,743
      controls. Two SNPs were taken forward to phase 4 genotyping (10,731 CRC cases and
      10,961 controls from eight centers). In addition to the previously reported 8q24,
      15q13 and 18q21 CRC risk loci, we identified two previously unreported
      associations: rs10795668, located at 10p14 (P = 2.5 x 10(-13) overall; P = 6.9 x 
      10(-12) replication), and rs16892766, at 8q23.3 (P = 3.3 x 10(-18) overall; P =
      9.6 x 10(-17) replication), which tags a plausible causative gene, EIF3H. These
      data provide further evidence for the 'common-disease common-variant' model of
      CRC predisposition.

AB  - In a genome-wide association study to identify loci associated with colorectal
      cancer (CRC) risk, we genotyped 555,510 SNPs in 1,012 early-onset Scottish CRC
      cases and 1,012 controls (phase 1). In phase 2, we genotyped the 15,008
      highest-ranked SNPs in 2,057 Scottish cases and 2,111 controls. We then genotyped
      the five highest-ranked SNPs from the joint phase 1 and 2 analysis in 14,500
      cases and 13,294 controls from seven populations, and identified a previously
      unreported association, rs3802842 on 11q23 (OR = 1.1; P = 5.8 x 10(-10)), showing
      population differences in risk. We also replicated and fine-mapped associations
      at 8q24 (rs7014346; OR = 1.19; P = 8.6 x 10(-26)) and 18q21 (rs4939827; OR = 1.2;
      P = 7.8 x 10(-28)). Risk was greater for rectal than for colon cancer for
      rs3802842 (P < 0.008) and rs4939827 (P < 0.009). Carrying all six possible risk
      alleles yielded OR = 2.6 (95% CI = 1.75-3.89) for CRC. These findings extend our 
      understanding of the role of common genetic variation in CRC etiology.

      6q22.33.
PG  - 4340-5
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0800441105 [doi]
AB  - We performed a three-phase genome-wide association study (GWAS) using cases and
      controls from a genetically isolated population, Ashkenazi Jews (AJ), to identify
      loci associated with breast cancer risk. In the first phase, we compared allele
      frequencies of 150,080 SNPs in 249 high-risk, BRCA1/2 mutation-negative AJ
      familial cases and 299 cancer-free AJ controls using chi(2) and the
      Cochran-Armitage trend tests. In the second phase, we genotyped 343 SNPs from 123
      regions most significantly associated from stage 1, including 4 SNPs from the
      FGFR2 region, in 950 consecutive AJ breast cancer cases and 979 age-matched AJ
      controls. We replicated major associations in a third independent set of 243 AJ
      cases and 187 controls. We obtained a significant allele P value of association
      with AJ breast cancer in the FGFR2 region (P = 1.5 x 10(-5), odds ratio (OR)
      1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-1.40 at rs1078806 for all phases
      combined). In addition, we found a risk locus in a region of chromosome 6q22.33
      (P = 2.9 x 10(-8), OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.25-1.59 at rs2180341). Using several SNPs at
      each implicated locus, we were able to verify associations and impute haplotypes.
      The major haplotype at the 6q22.33 locus conferred protection from disease,
      whereas the minor haplotype conferred risk. Candidate genes in the 6q22.33 region
      include ECHDC1, which encodes a protein involved in mitochondrial fatty acid
      oxidation, and also RNF146, which encodes a ubiquitin protein ligase, both known 
      pathways in breast cancer pathogenesis.

AB  - Prostate cancer is the most common cancer affecting males in developed countries.
      It shows consistent evidence of familial aggregation, but the causes of this
      aggregation are mostly unknown. To identify common alleles associated with
      prostate cancer risk, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using
      blood DNA samples from 1,854 individuals with clinically detected prostate cancer
      diagnosed at </=60 years or with a family history of disease, and 1,894
      population-screened controls with a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      concentration (<0.5 ng/ml). We analyzed these samples for 541,129 SNPs using the 
      Illumina Infinium platform. Initial putative associations were confirmed using a 
      further 3,268 cases and 3,366 controls. We identified seven loci associated with 
      prostate cancer on chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 19 and X (P = 2.7 x 10(-8) to P =
      8.7 x 10(-29)). We confirmed previous reports of common loci associated with
      prostate cancer at 8q24 and 17q. Moreover, we found that three of the newly
      identified loci contain candidate susceptibility genes: MSMB, LMTK2 and KLK3.

AB  - We followed our initial genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 527,869 SNPs on
      1,172 individuals with prostate cancer and 1,157 controls of European
      origin-nested in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer
      Screening Trial prospective study-by testing 26,958 SNPs in four independent
      studies (total of 3,941 cases and 3,964 controls). In the combined joint
      analysis, we confirmed three previously reported loci (two independent SNPs at
      8q24 and one in HNF1B (formerly known as TCF2 on 17q); P < 10(-10)). In addition,
      loci on chromosomes 7, 10 (two loci) and 11 were highly significant (between P < 
      7.31 x 10(-13) and P < 2.14 x 10(-6)). Loci on chromosome 10 include MSMB, which 
      encodes beta-microseminoprotein, a primary constituent of semen and a proposed
      prostate cancer biomarker, and CTBP2, a gene with antiapoptotic activity; the
      locus on chromosome 7 is at JAZF1, a transcriptional repressor that is fused by
      chromosome translocation to SUZ12 in endometrial cancer. Of the nine loci that
      showed highly suggestive associations (P < 2.5 x 10(-5)), four best fit a
      recessive model and included candidate susceptibility genes: CPNE3, IL16 and
      CDH13. Our findings point to multiple loci with moderate effects associated with 
      susceptibility to prostate cancer that, taken together, in the future may predict
      high risk in select individuals.

AB  - To identify risk variants for colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted a genome-wide
      association study, genotyping 550,163 tag SNPs in 940 individuals with familial
      colorectal tumor (627 CRC, 313 advanced adenomas) and 965 controls. We evaluated 
      selected SNPs in three replication sample sets (7,473 cases, 5,984 controls) and 
      identified three SNPs in SMAD7 (involved in TGF-beta and Wnt signaling)
      associated with CRC. Across the four sample sets, the association between
      rs4939827 and CRC was highly statistically significant (P(trend) = 1.0 x
      10(-12)).

TI  - A genome-wide association study of breast and prostate cancer in the NHLBI's
      Framingham Heart Study.
PG  - S6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast and prostate cancer are two commonly diagnosed cancers in the 
      United States. Prior work suggests that cancer causing genes and cancer
      susceptibility genes can be identified. METHODS: We conducted a genome-wide
      association study (Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip) of cancer in the community-based
      Framingham Heart Study. We report on 2 cancer traits--prostate cancer and breast 
      cancer--in up to 1335 participants from 330 families (54% women, mean entry age
      33 years). Multivariable-adjusted residuals, computed using Cox proportional
      hazards models, were tested for association with qualifying SNPs (70, 987
      autosomal SNPs with genotypic call rate > or =80%, minor allele frequency > or
      =10%, Hardy-Weinberg test p > or = 0.001) using generalized estimating equations 
      (GEE) models and family based association tests (FBAT). RESULTS: There were 58
      women with breast cancer and 59 men with prostate cancer. No SNP associations
      attained genome-wide significance. The top SNP associations in GEE models for
      each trait were as follows: breast cancer, rs2075555, p = 8.0 x 10(-8) in COL1A1;
      and prostate cancer, rs9311171, p = 1.75 x 10(-6) in CTDSPL. In analysis of
      selected candidate cancer susceptibility genes, two MSR1 SNPs (rs9325782, GEE p =
      0.008 and rs2410373, FBAT p = 0.021) were associated with prostate cancer and
      three ERBB4 SNPs (rs905883 GEE p = 0.0002, rs7564590 GEE p = 0.003, rs7558615 GEE
      p = 0.0078) were associated with breast cancer. The previously reported risk SNP 
      for prostate cancer, rs1447295, was not included on the 100K chip. Results of
      cancer phenotype-genotype associations for all autosomal SNPs are web posted at
      http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007 webcite. 
      CONCLUSION: Although no association attained genome-wide significance, several
      interesting associations emerged for breast and prostate cancer. These findings
      can serve as a resource for replication in other populations to identify novel
      biologic pathways contributing to cancer susceptibility.

TI  - A genome-wide association scan of tag SNPs identifies a susceptibility variant
      for colorectal cancer at 8q24.21.
PG  - 984-8
AB  - Much of the variation in inherited risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) is probably
      due to combinations of common low risk variants. We conducted a genome-wide
      association study of 550,000 tag SNPs in 930 familial colorectal tumor cases and 
      960 controls. The most strongly associated SNP (P = 1.72 x 10(-7), allelic test) 
      was rs6983267 at 8q24.21. To validate this finding, we genotyped rs6983267 in
      three additional CRC case-control series (4,361 affected individuals and 3,752
      controls; 1,901 affected individuals and 1,079 controls; 1,072 affected
      individuals and 415 controls) and replicated the association, providing P = 1.27 
      x 10(-14) (allelic test) overall, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.27 (95% confidence 
      interval (c.i.): 1.16-1.39) and 1.47 (95% c.i.: 1.34-1.62) for heterozygotes and 
      rare homozygotes, respectively. Analyses based on 1,477 individuals with
      colorectal adenoma and 2,136 controls suggest that susceptibility to CRC is
      mediated through development of adenomas (OR = 1.21, 95% c.i.: 1.10-1.34; P =
      6.89 x 10(-5)). These data show that common, low-penetrance susceptibility
      alleles predispose to colorectal neoplasia.

TI  - Genome-wide association scan identifies a colorectal cancer susceptibility locus 
      on chromosome 8q24.
PG  - 989-94
AB  - Using a multistage genetic association approach comprising 7,480 affected
      individuals and 7,779 controls, we identified markers in chromosomal region 8q24 
      associated with colorectal cancer. In stage 1, we genotyped 99,632 SNPs in 1,257 
      affected individuals and 1,336 controls from Ontario. In stages 2-4, we performed
      serial replication studies using 4,024 affected individuals and 4,042 controls
      from Seattle, Newfoundland and Scotland. We identified one locus on chromosome
      8q24 and another on 9p24 having combined odds ratios (OR) for stages 1-4 of 1.18 
      (trend; P = 1.41 x 10(-8)) and 1.14 (trend; P = 1.32 x 10(-5)), respectively.
      Additional analyses in 2,199 affected individuals and 2,401 controls from France 
      and Europe supported the association at the 8q24 locus (OR = 1.16, trend; 95%
      confidence interval (c.i.): 1.07-1.26; P = 5.05 x 10(-4)). A summary across all
      seven studies at the 8q24 locus was highly significant (OR = 1.17, c.i.:
      1.12-1.23; P = 3.16 x 10(-11)). This locus has also been implicated in prostate
      cancer.

TI  - Two variants on chromosome 17 confer prostate cancer risk, and the one in TCF2
      protects against type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 977-83
AB  - We performed a genome-wide association scan to search for sequence variants
      conferring risk of prostate cancer using 1,501 Icelandic men with prostate cancer
      and 11,290 controls. Follow-up studies involving three additional case-control
      groups replicated an association of two variants on chromosome 17 with the
      disease. These two variants, 33 Mb apart, fall within a region previously
      implicated by family-based linkage studies on prostate cancer. The risks
      conferred by these variants are moderate individually (allele odds ratio of about
      1.20), but because they are common, their joint population attributable risk is
      substantial. One of the variants is in TCF2 (HNF1beta), a gene known to be
      mutated in individuals with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5. Results 
      from eight case-control groups, including one West African and one Chinese,
      demonstrate that this variant confers protection against type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Common variants on chromosomes 2q35 and 16q12 confer susceptibility to estrogen
      receptor-positive breast cancer.
PG  - 865-9
AB  - Familial clustering studies indicate that breast cancer risk has a substantial
      genetic component. To identify new breast cancer risk variants, we genotyped
      approximately 300,000 SNPs in 1,600 Icelandic individuals with breast cancer and 
      11,563 controls using the Illumina Hap300 platform. We then tested selected SNPs 
      in five replication sample sets. Overall, we studied 4,554 affected individuals
      and 17,577 controls. Two SNPs consistently associated with breast cancer:
      approximately 25% of individuals of European descent are homozygous for allele A 
      of rs13387042 on chromosome 2q35 and have an estimated 1.44-fold greater risk
      than noncarriers, and for allele T of rs3803662 on 16q12, about 7% are homozygous
      and have a 1.64-fold greater risk. Risk from both alleles was confined to
      estrogen receptor-positive tumors. At present, no genes have been identified in
      the linkage disequilibrium block containing rs13387042. rs3803662 is near the 5' 
      end of TNRC9 , a high mobility group chromatin-associated protein whose
      expression is implicated in breast cancer metastasis to bone.

TI  - A genome-wide association study identifies alleles in FGFR2 associated with risk 
      of sporadic postmenopausal breast cancer.
PG  - 870-4
AB  - We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of breast cancer by
      genotyping 528,173 SNPs in 1,145 postmenopausal women of European ancestry with
      invasive breast cancer and 1,142 controls. We identified four SNPs in intron 2 of
      FGFR2 (which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase and is amplified or overexpressed
      in some breast cancers) that were highly associated with breast cancer and
      confirmed this association in 1,776 affected individuals and 2,072 controls from 
      three additional studies. Across the four studies, the association with all four 
      SNPs was highly statistically significant (P(trend) for the most strongly
      associated SNP (rs1219648) = 1.1 x 10(-10); population attributable risk = 16%). 
      Four SNPs at other loci most strongly associated with breast cancer in the
      initial GWAS were not associated in the replication studies. Our summary results 
      from the GWAS are available online in a form that should speed the identification
      of additional risk loci.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies novel breast cancer susceptibility loci.
PG  - 1087-93
AB  - Breast cancer exhibits familial aggregation, consistent with variation in genetic
      susceptibility to the disease. Known susceptibility genes account for less than
      25% of the familial risk of breast cancer, and the residual genetic variance is
      likely to be due to variants conferring more moderate risks. To identify further 
      susceptibility alleles, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study in
      4,398 breast cancer cases and 4,316 controls, followed by a third stage in which 
      30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for confirmation in 21,860 
      cases and 22,578 controls from 22 studies. We used 227,876 SNPs that were
      estimated to correlate with 77% of known common SNPs in Europeans at r2 > 0.5.
      SNPs in five novel independent loci exhibited strong and consistent evidence of
      association with breast cancer (P < 10(-7)). Four of these contain plausible
      causative genes (FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1 and LSP1). At the second stage, 1,792 SNPs 
      were significant at the P < 0.05 level compared with an estimated 1,343 that
      would be expected by chance, indicating that many additional common
      susceptibility alleles may be identifiable by this approach.

TI  - Genome-wide association study identifies a second prostate cancer susceptibility 
      variant at 8q24.
PG  - 631-7
AB  - Prostate cancer is the most prevalent noncutaneous cancer in males in developed
      regions, with African American men having among the highest worldwide incidence
      and mortality rates. Here we report a second genetic variant in the 8q24 region
      that, in conjunction with another variant we recently discovered, accounts for
      about 11%-13% of prostate cancer cases in individuals of European descent and 31%
      of cases in African Americans. We made the current discovery through a
      genome-wide association scan of 1,453 affected Icelandic individuals and 3,064
      controls using the Illumina HumanHap300 BeadChip followed by four replication
      studies. A key step in the discovery was the construction of a 14-SNP haplotype
      that efficiently tags a relatively uncommon (2%-4%) susceptibility variant in
      individuals of European descent that happens to be very common (approximately
      42%) in African Americans. The newly identified variant shows a stronger
      association with affected individuals who have an earlier age at diagnosis.

TI  - Genome-wide association study of prostate cancer identifies a second risk locus
      at 8q24.
PG  - 645-9
AB  - Recently, common variants on human chromosome 8q24 were found to be associated
      with prostate cancer risk. While conducting a genome-wide association study in
      the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility project with 550,000 SNPs in a
      nested case-control study (1,172 cases and 1,157 controls of European origin), we
      identified a new association at 8q24 with an independent effect on prostate
      cancer susceptibility. The most significant signal is 70 kb centromeric to the
      previously reported SNP, rs1447295, but shows little evidence of linkage
      disequilibrium with it. A combined analysis with four additional studies (total: 
      4,296 cases and 4,299 controls) confirms association with prostate cancer for
      rs6983267 in the centromeric locus (P = 9.42 x 10(-13); heterozygote odds ratio
      (OR): 1.26, 95% confidence interval (c.i.): 1.13-1.41; homozygote OR: 1.58, 95%
      c.i.: 1.40-1.78). Each SNP remained significant in a joint analysis after
      adjusting for the other (rs1447295 P = 1.41 x 10(-11); rs6983267 P = 6.62 x
      10(-10)). These observations, combined with compelling evidence for a
      recombination hotspot between the two markers, indicate the presence of at least 
      two independent loci within 8q24 that contribute to prostate cancer in men of
      European ancestry. We estimate that the population attributable risk of the new
      locus, marked by rs6983267, is higher than the locus marked by rs1447295 (21%
      versus 9%).
