TI  - Genetic variant predictors of gene expression provide new insight into risk of
      colorectal cancer.

AB  - Genome-wide association studies have reported 56 independently associated
      colorectal cancer (CRC) risk variants, most of which are non-coding and believed 
      to exert their effects by modulating gene expression. The computational method
      PrediXcan uses cis-regulatory variant predictors to impute expression and perform
      gene-level association tests in GWAS without directly measured transcriptomes. In
      this study, we used reference datasets from colon (n = 169) and whole blood (n = 
      922) transcriptomes to test CRC association with genetically determined
      expression levels in a genome-wide analysis of 12,186 cases and 14,718 controls. 
      Three novel associations were discovered from colon transverse models at FDR </= 
      0.2 and further evaluated in an independent replication including 32,825 cases
      and 39,933 controls. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, we found
      statistically significant associations using colon transcriptome models with
      TRIM4 (discovery P = 2.2 x 10(- 4), replication P = 0.01), and PYGL (discovery P 
      = 2.3 x 10(- 4), replication P = 6.7 x 10(- 4)). Interestingly, both genes encode
      proteins that influence redox homeostasis and are related to cellular metabolic
      reprogramming in tumors, implicating a novel CRC pathway linked to cell growth
      and proliferation. Defining CRC risk regions as one megabase up- and downstream
      of one of the 56 independent risk variants, we defined 44 non-overlapping
      CRC-risk regions. Among these risk regions, we identified genes associated with
      CRC (P < 0.05) in 34/44 CRC-risk regions. Importantly, CRC association was found 
      for two genes in the previously reported 2q25 locus, CXCR1 and CXCR2, which are
      potential cancer therapeutic targets. These findings provide strong candidate
      genes to prioritize for subsequent laboratory follow-up of GWAS loci. This study 
      is the first to implement PrediXcan in a large colorectal cancer study and
      findings highlight the utility of integrating transcriptome data in GWAS for
      discovery of, and biological insight into, risk loci.
